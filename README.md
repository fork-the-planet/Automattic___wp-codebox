# WP Codebox

**WP Codebox unlocks secure WordPress code execution from anywhere.** Run agents, accept untrusted patches, evaluate plugins, reproduce bugs, or experiment freely — every sandbox is a disposable WordPress Playground that can't touch its caller. Your host can be a CLI, CI job, mobile app, Node service, WordPress plugin, or anything else that can shell out or hit an API.

WordPress has historically lacked a clean scratch space for code execution. Modern dev workflows assume one — Node has `npm install` per project, Python has venvs, containers have ephemeral filesystems. WordPress Playground finally provides that primitive: real WordPress, PHP-in-WASM, fully ephemeral, no host filesystem access except via declared mounts. WP Codebox wraps Playground into a usable runtime contract so any product — WordPress or not — can offer code execution against a real WordPress instance without risking the caller.

WP Codebox is the runtime boundary for agent-built or workflow-built outputs. It is not the agent framework, the review UI, the deploy system, or the production site mutator. The WordPress plugin in this repo is one optional host adapter (useful when the host *is* a WordPress site); the core CLI/runtime works anywhere `node` can run.

## Product Use Cases

What you can build on top of WP Codebox:

- **Agentic coding against a WordPress site.** Let users describe a change in chat — from any host: a WordPress plugin, a mobile app, a desktop tool, a Slack/Discord bot. Dispatch a sandbox with the target site's stack mounted, capture an artifact with a live Playground preview URL, then let the parent control plane review, apply, and open any PR. The contributor never needs shell access.
- **Agent training and evaluation.** Run the same WordPress task side by side across multiple models in isolated Playground workspaces. Capture each model's output, grade against hidden quality checks, and produce per-model review artifacts. Example implementation: [wp-gym](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-gym).
- **Long-running terrariums.** Boot a Playground that an agent evolves over time — software, content, configuration — with day-cycle automation driven from CI. See [world-of-wordpress](https://github.com/chubes4/world-of-wordpress).
- **Static-site / WordPress-import factories.** Generate raw HTML/CSS sites in CI, validate them via Playground + WordPress import, post Playground preview links as PR evidence. See [wp-site-generator](https://github.com/chubes4/wp-site-generator).
- **Untrusted patch evaluation.** Plugin and theme authors can accept community-submitted patches, run them in a sandbox, capture artifacts (diffs, test results, screenshots), and review before merging. The reviewing tool can be anything.
- **"Try it in a sandbox first."** Before installing a plugin, theme, or update on a production site, run it in a disposable Playground and see what happens.
- **Reproduction harness for bug reports.** Ship a recipe with an issue so any contributor can replay the bug deterministically in a clean WordPress instance. The replay can be triggered from a CLI, a CI job, or a maintainer's IDE plugin.
- **Hosting provider integrations.** "Test this change in a sandbox" buttons in admin dashboards or hosting panels.
- **CI/CD safety net.** Dispatch a sandbox from a GitHub Action or other CI runner to evaluate a PR's runtime behavior against real WordPress before merging.
- **Mobile / native dev tools.** A mobile coding assistant or desktop dev tool can drive sandboxes for real WordPress execution without bundling PHP locally.
- **Education.** Real WordPress instances per student per exercise, fully disposable.
- **Security research.** Detonate suspicious plugins, themes, or patches in isolation.

## Runtime Capabilities

What WP Codebox provides for product use cases:

- Run a PHP or WP-CLI probe against mounted WordPress code.
- Validate raw WordPress Playground blueprints through the same runtime and artifact contract.
- Execute a WordPress Ability inside a disposable Playground runtime.
- Run repeatable workspace recipes that mount plugins, seed workspaces, and capture outputs.
- Drive stateful runtime episodes with reset, step, observe, snapshot, artifact, and close operations.
- Launch sandboxed Data Machine / Agents API coding-agent tasks from the CLI or WordPress ability surface.
- Fan out several task descriptions into separate isolated sandboxes.
- Produce artifact bundles — patches, diffs, test results, live Playground preview URLs — that a parent product can review, replay, apply, or discard.

## Browser Site Operations

The WordPress plugin ships a browser runtime helper at
`window.wpCodeboxBrowser` for product callers that drive a WordPress Playground
from the browser. Low-level helpers such as `runPhpRequest`,
`runWordPressOperation`, `ensureDirectory`, and `writeFile` remain available for
custom workflows. Prefer the typed site-operation helpers for common safe
actions because they validate input and return a normalized product envelope:

```js
{
  operation: "setFrontendAdminBarVisible",
  status: "ok",
  target: "frontendAdminBar",
  key: "show_admin_bar_front",
  data: { visible: false },
  errors: [],
}
```

Current safe helpers:

- `setFrontendAdminBarVisible(client, { visible, userId? })` toggles the
  frontend admin bar preference for a Playground user. `visible` must be a
  boolean, and `userId` must be a positive integer when supplied.
- `writeReviewFile(client, { path, content, encoding? })` writes review or
  artifact notes below the Playground uploads `wp-codebox/reviews` directory.
  `path` must be a relative path without `.` or `..` segments.

These helpers mutate only the disposable Playground runtime. Parent products
remain responsible for reviewing artifacts and deciding whether to apply any
result outside the sandbox.

## Host Tool Registry

`HostToolRegistry` is a WP Codebox transport adapter, not a generic tool
contract. Agents API owns canonical tool declarations, tool calls, execution
results, pending external-tool states, and product-neutral runtime metadata.
Data Machine or another host owns the concrete tool sources and product policy.
WP Codebox only exposes caller-provided per-run tool declarations to sandbox
agents, routes allowed calls across the browser/host boundary, and records
transport diagnostics.

Host products can register a caller-provided canonical tool declaration plus a
host-side handler without adding product-specific logic to WP Codebox core. The
runtime still gates execution through `RuntimePolicy.commands`, so callers must
explicitly allow each registered canonical tool name before a sandbox can invoke
it.

```ts
import { createHostToolRegistry, createRuntime } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-core"
import { createPlaygroundRuntimeBackend } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-playground"

const hostTools = createHostToolRegistry([
  {
    declaration: {
      name: "client/echo",
      description: "Echo a structured payload from the host bridge.",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        required: ["message"],
        properties: { message: { type: "string" } },
        additionalProperties: false,
      },
      executor: "client",
      scope: "run",
      runtime: { completion_signal: "progress" },
    },
    name: "client/echo",
    description: "Echo a structured payload from the host bridge.",
    outputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      required: ["message"],
      properties: { message: { type: "string" } },
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
    policy: { capability: "client/echo", risk: "read" },
    handler: (input) => input,
  },
])

const runtime = await createRuntime({
  backend: "wordpress-playground",
  environment: { kind: "wordpress", version: "latest" },
  policy: {
    network: "deny",
    filesystem: "sandbox",
    commands: ["client/echo"],
    secrets: "none",
    approvals: "never",
  },
  hostTools,
}, createPlaygroundRuntimeBackend())

const result = await runtime.execute({
  command: "client/echo",
  args: ['input-json={"message":"hello"}'],
})
```

Host tool output is a Codebox transport diagnostic envelope with schema
`wp-codebox/host-tool-result/v1`. Successful calls return `status: "ok"`, an
`output` value validated against the transport output schema, and `toolResult`
using the canonical Agents API result shape: `success`, `tool_name`, `result`,
`metadata`, and optional `runtime`. Invalid input, invalid output, malformed
JSON, and handler failures return `status: "error"` with a stable transport error
code while `toolResult` maps the same failure to a canonical tool error. The
`diagnostics` object is the Codebox-owned portion of the envelope and preserves
the transport, policy command, validation schemas, and resolved policy metadata.

Product-specific tools such as Homeboy evidence commands should live in product
extensions that provide canonical tool declarations and handlers through this
transport surface. Codebox should not encode Data Machine policy semantics,
product tool names, or cross-product tool mediation rules in this layer.

Trusted worker hosts that need repo-local commands can use the playground
package's `createHostCommandTool()` adapter instead of exposing arbitrary shell.
Each adapter is still a named host tool such as `host.pnpm-test`,
`host.cargo-test`, or `host.project-check`; the runtime denies it unless that
exact name appears in `policy.commands`. The adapter runs one configured
executable with `child_process.spawn()` and `shell: false`, appends only
structured string-array arguments from the input, enforces allowed cwd roots,
uses an explicit timeout, captures bounded stdout/stderr, and passes only
configured environment variables plus explicitly allowlisted input env keys.

```ts
import { createHostToolRegistry } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-core"
import { createHostCommandTool } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-playground"

const hostTools = createHostToolRegistry([
  createHostCommandTool({
    name: "host.pnpm-test",
    description: "Run repo-local tests from a trusted worker host.",
    command: "pnpm",
    args: ["test"],
    cwd: repoRoot,
    allowedCwdRoots: [repoRoot],
    timeoutMs: 120_000,
    maxOutputBytes: 256 * 1024,
    inheritedEnv: ["CI"],
  }),
])
```

## In-Sandbox Workspace Contract

WP Codebox reserves `/workspace` as the stable editable workspace root inside a
sandbox. Repo-backed tasks mount a repository at `/workspace` and preserve the
repository layout exactly, so `wing-map-display/blocks/map/render.php` in the
repo is `/workspace/wing-map-display/blocks/map/render.php` in the sandbox.
Site-backed tasks mount a site snapshot under the same root, normally with
`/workspace/wp-content/...` paths, and produce a changed-files bundle rather
than a git patch against a repo `HEAD`.

`wp-content` runtime mounts can coexist with `/workspace` mounts. A caller may
mount the same source into `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/<slug>` so WordPress
loads it, and into `/workspace/<repo-relative-path>` so DMC tools edit it with
repo-relative paths. Artifact metadata records both mount targets and any opaque
mount metadata such as `repo`, `gitRef`, `default_branch`, `workspaceRef`,
`component`, `wpContentPath`, and `sourceMode`.

Artifact bundles include `metadata.json.provenance.workspace` with:

- `root`: always `/workspace` for the v1 contract.
- `defaultMode`: `repo-backed` unless a mount declares `sourceMode: site-backed`.
- `mounts`: normalized workspace mount refs for repo components and site
  snapshots.
- `toolPolicy`: optional caller-owned sandbox tool policy snapshot when the
  recipe provides one.

Sandbox agents may read, write, edit, patch, grep, list, and diff files inside
the mounted workspace. Read-only GitHub abilities may be exposed for context.
Push, deploy, worktree lifecycle, GitSync, PR creation, issue mutation, comments,
merge, cleanup, and apply-back operations stay parent-only. The sandbox produces
artifacts; the parent site decides whether and how to apply them.

## Why A WordPress Plugin?

The WordPress plugin is useful when the host experience should live inside a
WordPress site. It turns WP Codebox into a WordPress-native control plane for
reviewed coding workflows without asking users to run a terminal.

Good fits include:

- Letting non-technical site owners request, review, and approve bounded coding changes from a WordPress UI or chat surface.
- Running a managed coding community where users submit tasks and maintainers approve sandboxed artifacts before anything reaches real code.
- Supporting WordPress contributors with disposable reproduction, patch, review, and test-result artifacts that can be shared before commit or PR creation.

These are host-product use cases. The core runtime still works anywhere the CLI
can run.

## Repo Components

These are local workspace components in this repo. The CLI and WordPress plugin
now have package artifact validation, but publication and release automation are
still explicit release-manager steps.

- `packages/runtime-core`: backend-agnostic runtime interfaces and shared types.
- `packages/runtime-playground`: WordPress Playground backend adapter.
- `packages/cli`: source for the local `wp-codebox` CLI used through `npm run wp-codebox`.
- `packages/wordpress-plugin`: parent-site WordPress ability surface.

## Local Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run check
```

`npm run check` runs the TypeScript build, policy validation smoke test, WordPress plugin smoke test, and a real Playground-backed CLI smoke test.

## Distribution Artifacts

The GitHub Release workspace tarball exposes the stable `wp-codebox` binary from
`packages/cli/dist/index.js`. The scoped npm packages are prepared under
`@automattic/wp-codebox-*`, but they are not published yet; do not document
`npm install -g @automattic/wp-codebox-cli` as an available install path until
the package exists in the registry.

```bash
npm run build
npm pack --workspace @automattic/wp-codebox-cli --dry-run --json
npm pack --json
```

Install a GitHub Release tarball built from a release that includes the root
`bin` mapping when a downstream control plane needs a stable binary path without
pointing at a local feature worktree:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/Automattic/wp-codebox/releases/download/v<VERSION>/wp-codebox-workspace-<VERSION>.tgz
wp-codebox commands --json
wp-codebox recipe validate --recipe ./examples/recipes/cookbook/codex-agent-smoke.json --json
```

`v0.4.0` includes the fresh sandbox session fix and Codex recipe example, but its
release asset predates the root `bin` mapping. Release managers need to cut a new
release from a commit containing this section before relying on the GitHub
Release tarball as the stable installed binary path.

For a future npm release, publish all three scoped packages from the same clean
release commit after approval:

```bash
npm publish --workspace @automattic/wp-codebox-core --access public
npm publish --workspace @automattic/wp-codebox-playground --access public
npm publish --workspace @automattic/wp-codebox-cli --access public
```

The WordPress plugin zip is built from `packages/wordpress-plugin` with only the
installable plugin files under a top-level `wp-codebox/` directory.

```bash
npm run package:wordpress-plugin
unzip -Z1 packages/wordpress-plugin/dist/wp-codebox.zip
```

`npm run package-distribution-smoke` validates both artifact shapes. It checks
that the CLI pack includes `package.json`, `README.md`, and compiled `dist/`
files without TypeScript source, checks that the root release tarball installs a
`wp-codebox` binary, then builds the WordPress plugin zip and checks that it
contains the plugin bootstrap, README, PHP sources, checked-in browser runtime
asset, and vendored CLI runtime without package metadata or generated artifacts.
`npm run package-installed-binary-smoke` packs the root release tarball, installs
it into a temporary global prefix, and verifies the installed `wp-codebox`
binary can emit the command catalog.

Versioning and release policy:

1. Release the workspace packages together from one git tag so
   `@automattic/wp-codebox-cli`, `@automattic/wp-codebox-core`, and
   `@automattic/wp-codebox-playground` stay on the same version.
2. Keep `packages/wordpress-plugin/wp-codebox.php` `Version:` aligned with the
   package version used for the matching plugin zip.
3. Treat the release tarball, npm packages, and plugin zip as one release unit:
   attach the root `wp-codebox-workspace-<version>.tgz` tarball, publish the
   scoped npm packages when approved, build the plugin zip from the same commit,
   and attach the zip to the release.
4. Use conventional semver: patch for fixes and docs-only distribution updates,
   minor for new commands or artifact fields, major for runtime contract breaks.

Install notes by environment:

1. Self-hosted WordPress control planes should install the CLI on the same host
   that runs PHP from the GitHub Release workspace tarball, install
   `packages/wordpress-plugin/dist/wp-codebox.zip` as the parent-site plugin,
   then set `wp_codebox_bin` to the resolved `wp-codebox` binary path. Component
   paths can be supplied through `wp_codebox_component_paths` or the matching
   filter.
2. Studio or local development environments can run from a checkout with
   `npm install`, `npm run build`, and `npm run wp-codebox -- ...`; install the
   plugin zip into the local parent site and point `wp_codebox_bin` at either
   the global binary or the checkout wrapper command used by that site.
3. Hosted control planes should provide WP Codebox as managed infrastructure:
   deploy the vetted CLI package and plugin zip from the same release, configure
   the binary and component paths centrally with options or filters, and expose
   only the parent-site abilities to products.

CLI binary discovery from the plugin is intentionally host-configurable. The
runner resolves the binary from ability input first, then `wp_codebox_bin`, then
the `wp_codebox_bin` filter; multisite installs read the option from network
options because the executable path is host-level configuration.

Release checklist:

1. Run `npm run check` from a clean checkout.
2. Run `npm run package-installed-binary-smoke` to verify the root release
   tarball installs a working `wp-codebox` binary.
3. Review `npm pack --workspace @automattic/wp-codebox-cli --dry-run --json` before publishing the CLI package.
4. Build `packages/wordpress-plugin/dist/wp-codebox.zip` with
   `npm run package:wordpress-plugin` and inspect
   `unzip -Z1 packages/wordpress-plugin/dist/wp-codebox.zip`.
5. Confirm package and plugin versions are aligned on the release commit.
6. Build the root release tarball and attach it to the matching GitHub Release:
   `npm pack --json`. The expected asset name is
   `wp-codebox-workspace-<version>.tgz`.
7. If npm publishing is approved, publish the scoped packages with the exact
   `npm publish --workspace ... --access public` commands above.
8. Install the CLI in the target environment and configure the WordPress plugin
   `wp_codebox_bin` option or filter to the resolved `wp-codebox` binary path.
9. Install the plugin zip on the parent site and run the WordPress plugin smoke
   or equivalent ability registration check in that environment.

## Quick Start

Run PHP inside a disposable WordPress Playground runtime with a local plugin mounted:

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- run \
  --mount ./examples/simple-plugin:/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/simple-plugin \
  --command wordpress.run-php \
  --arg code-file=./examples/simple-plugin/probe.php \
  --artifacts ./artifacts \
  --json
```

Expected shape:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "runtime": {
    "backend": "wordpress-playground",
    "status": "destroyed"
  },
  "execution": {
    "command": "wordpress.run-php",
    "exitCode": 0
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "id": "artifact-bundle-sha256-...",
    "contentDigest": "...",
    "directory": "./artifacts/runtime-...",
    "manifestPath": "./artifacts/runtime-.../manifest.json",
    "blueprintAfterPath": "./artifacts/runtime-.../blueprint.after.json",
    "capturedMountsPath": "./artifacts/runtime-.../files/mounted-files.json",
    "diffsPath": "./artifacts/runtime-.../files/diffs.json",
    "changedFilesPath": "./artifacts/runtime-.../files/changed-files.json",
    "patchPath": "./artifacts/runtime-.../files/patch.diff",
    "testResultsPath": "./artifacts/runtime-.../files/test-results.json"
  }
}
```

WP Codebox boots Playground lazily on the first command, captures artifacts after execution, and disposes the runtime when the run completes.

Recipe runs also write a registry entry under the run registry directory
(`artifacts/runs` by default, or `--run-registry <dir>`). Poll it with
`wp-codebox runs status --registry <dir> --run-id <id> --json`. The returned
record keeps the existing flat `status` field and adds `lifecycle`, a concise
machine contract for orchestrators:

```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "lifecycle": {
    "schema": "wp-codebox/run-lifecycle/v1",
    "phase": "terminal",
    "terminal": true,
    "cancellable": false,
    "successful": true,
    "failed": false,
    "cancelled": false,
    "outcome": "succeeded",
    "cleanup": {
      "status": "succeeded",
      "attempts": 1
    }
  }
}
```

Orchestrators should use `lifecycle.terminal`, `lifecycle.outcome`, and
`lifecycle.cleanup.status` instead of scraping human logs. Timeout and signal
interruptions settle as `timed_out` and `cancelled` outcomes respectively.

## Runtime Evidence

Recipe runs write runtime evidence under `files/runtime-evidence/`. Every recipe
run includes `run-attestation.json`, a generic attestation with the WP Codebox
package identity, git commit when available, Playground backend package/version,
WordPress runtime version, command-policy hash, policy enforcement states,
references to workspace-policy and artifact-verifier results when configured,
and redacted secret-envelope metadata.

The attestation treats runtime command, network, filesystem, secrets, and
approval policies as sealed because WP Codebox enforces them while executing the
run. Workspace policy and artifact verification are sealed only when their
recipe options are enabled with `strict: true`; when enabled without strict mode,
their result artifacts are recorded as advisory/declarative evidence. Secret
values are never written to the attestation; it records only names, counts,
availability, and the redaction mode.

Workspace policy evidence rejects symlinks, special files, nested `.git`
metadata, hidden-policy paths, paths outside writable roots, gitlinks,
unmerged-index entries, ignored files in git-backed mode, and regular files with
more than one hard link. The hard-link check uses the host platform's
`lstat().nlink` value and fails closed if the link count cannot be determined,
because a hard-linked file under an allowed root is not independent evidence.

For interactive review, pass `--preview-hold <duration>` to keep the live Playground server available briefly after artifact capture. The command emits `artifacts.preview.url` and `files/review.json` includes a matching top-level `preview` object with lifecycle and expiry details.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- run \
  --mount ./examples/simple-plugin:/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/simple-plugin \
  --command wordpress.run-php \
  --arg code-file=./examples/simple-plugin/probe.php \
  --artifacts ./artifacts \
  --preview-hold 15m \
  --json
```

The v1 preview is a held live Playground runtime. When `--preview-hold` is omitted, the preview field still records the URL observed during capture, but the runtime is destroyed on command completion and the URL is marked `expired-on-completion`. Artifact replay from `blueprint.after.json` remains partial and is a separate future preview mode.

For tunnel-first review, reserve the local port in the tunnel command and pass that same port to WP Codebox. `--preview-port <n>` makes WP Codebox expose Playground through a fixed local proxy port instead of reporting Playground's default random port, and `--preview-public-url <url>` reports the tunnel URL in `artifacts.preview.url`, `metadata.json`, and `files/review.json`.

```bash
kimaki tunnel -- sh -c 'npm run wp-codebox -- run \
  --mount ./examples/simple-plugin:/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/simple-plugin \
  --command wordpress.run-php \
  --arg code-file=./examples/simple-plugin/probe.php \
  --artifacts ./artifacts \
  --preview-hold 15m \
  --preview-port 4173 \
  --preview-public-url "$TRAFORO_URL" \
  --json'
```

When a caller exposes the local Playground through a tunnel or proxy, pass `--preview-public-url <url>` to report that public URL in `artifacts.preview.url`, `metadata.json`, and `files/review.json`. WP Codebox also passes the same URL to Playground as `site-url` and defines `WP_HOME` / `WP_SITEURL` in the sandbox config, so WordPress-generated links and canonical redirects align with the public preview URL. The local proxy URL remains recorded as `preview.localUrl`. If the fixed port is already occupied, WP Codebox fails clearly with `EADDRINUSE` and the requested `--preview-port` value.

Remote-host previews can opt into `--preview-bind <host>` with `--preview-port`. The flag changes the WP Codebox preview proxy bind address only; the upstream Playground server remains loopback-bound because `@wp-playground/cli` does not expose host/bind control yet. The default stays `127.0.0.1`. Use `--preview-bind 0.0.0.0` only behind trusted firewall, tunnel, or reverse-proxy controls because the sandbox preview is reachable for the hold duration. Track the upstream Playground bind-host API gap in https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/3681.

## Runtime Episodes

Use `createRuntimeEpisode()` when a caller needs a stateful sandbox loop instead
of a one-shot command or recipe. The episode wrapper is generic: it records reset
observations, step executions, optional per-step observations, snapshots, and
artifact bundles without knowing benchmark, reward, or scenario semantics.

```ts
import { createRuntimeEpisode } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-core"
import { createPlaygroundRuntimeBackend } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-playground"

const episode = await createRuntimeEpisode(
  {
    runtime: {
      backend: "wordpress-playground",
      environment: { kind: "wordpress", version: "7.0", blueprint: { steps: [] } },
      policy: {
        network: "deny",
        filesystem: "readwrite-mounts",
        commands: ["wordpress.wp-cli", "wordpress.run-php"],
        secrets: "none",
        approvals: "never",
      },
    },
    stepObservation: { type: "runtime-info" },
  },
  createPlaygroundRuntimeBackend(),
)

await episode.step({ command: "wordpress.wp-cli", args: ["command=post list"] })
const artifacts = await episode.collectArtifacts({ includeLogs: true })
const trace = await episode.trace()
await episode.close()
```

When `collectArtifacts()` runs for an episode, WP Codebox persists the trace into
the artifact bundle at `files/runtime-episode-trace.json` and writes a compact
stream form to `files/runtime-episode.jsonl`. The bundle manifest advertises
those files with `runtime-episode-trace` and `runtime-episode-events` kinds,
`metadata.json` lists them under `artifacts.runtimeEpisodeTrace` and
`artifacts.runtimeEpisodeEvents`, and `files/review.json` includes
`evidence.runtimeEpisodeTrace` for review tooling. `verifyArtifactBundle()`
checks the advertised trace file exists and validates against
`wp-codebox/runtime-episode-trace/v1`.

Artifact bundles also include `files/runtime-reference-manifest.json` using
schema `wp-codebox/runtime-reference-manifest/v1`. This manifest is a stable,
hashable index of runtime-related refs: the artifact-bundle id/digest,
bundle-relative artifact file refs with SHA-256 values, optional trace/events
refs, and snapshot refs. Its id is `runtime-reference-manifest-sha256-<digest>`,
where the digest is computed from the declared refs rather than presentation
fields such as `createdAt`. `verifyArtifactBundle()` validates the manifest
shape, referenced file hashes, artifact-bundle digest, and id/digest pairing.

Products such as eval harnesses can project this generic episode trace into their
own action, observation, reward, and report schemas outside WP Codebox.

The episode trace is a versioned machine-verifiable contract with schema
`wp-codebox/runtime-episode-trace/v1`. `@automattic/wp-codebox-core` exports
`RUNTIME_EPISODE_TRACE_JSON_SCHEMA` for schema-aware consumers and
`validateRuntimeEpisodeTrace()` for lightweight runtime checks. The trace stays
generic: it carries runtime, reset, step, action, execution, observation,
snapshot, and artifact references only. Domain fields such as reward, grader,
scenario, benchmark, task-set, and model-eval belong in consumers that project
the trace into their own schemas.

Episode steps include stable ids and refs for the step, requested action,
runtime execution, optional observation, and collected artifact bundle. Actions
use the generic `wp-codebox/runtime-episode-action/v1` envelope with
`kind: "command" | "filesystem" | "http" | "browser"`, the underlying command
execution name, string args, optional replay intent fields such as `method`,
`url`, `path`, `operation`, `selector`, and a SHA-256 digest over that canonical
payload. Non-command action kinds preserve higher-level runtime intent while the
command execution remains the compatibility primitive.

Observations use the generic `wp-codebox/runtime-episode-observation/v1`
envelope with id, type, data, timestamp, optional artifact refs, and digest. The
Playground backend provides structured observation types for `runtime-info`,
`mounts`, `command-result`, `wordpress-state`, `http-response`,
`browser-result`, `runtime-events`, and `runtime-logs`. Large observation
payloads can be stored as bundle-relative artifacts and referenced by digest.
Refs carry matching digests so callers can compare action args, observations,
executions, snapshots, and artifacts without parsing presentation logs.

`wordpress-state` is a generic WordPress runtime state export with schema
`wp-codebox/wordpress-state-export/v1`. The default request remains small and
safe: `{ type: "wordpress-state" }` exports the summary section only, including
site/home URLs, WordPress version, active theme/plugins, and post counts. Callers
that need richer evidence can pass a section allowlist:

```ts
await episode.observe({
  type: "wordpress-state",
  sections: ["summary", "posts", "terms", "menus", "templates", "media", "options", "users", "rest-routes", "abilities"],
  optionNames: ["blogname", "permalink_structure"],
  userFields: ["roles"],
})
```

Each exported section is written as a bundle-relative artifact under
`files/observations/`, with a SHA-256 digest in both the observation data and the
observation `artifactRefs`. The inline observation data summarizes non-summary
sections by count/key metadata so traces stay compact. Posts, templates,
template parts, and global styles include content hashes by default; pass
`includeContent: true` only when full post content, template content, template
part content, or the raw global-style stylesheet is needed. Options require
`optionNames`; users are redacted by default, expose only allowed
role/capability fields, and include identity fields only with `redaction: "none"`
plus an explicit `userFields` allowlist.

The canonical replayable WordPress state artifact contracts are:

- `wp-codebox/wordpress-state-export/v1`: the inline observation data. It is an
  object with `schema`, `version: 1`, `generatedAt`, the normalized request
  `config`, compact `sections` summaries, and an `artifacts` map keyed by section
  name. Each artifact entry contains `artifact`, `sha256`, and `bytes`.
- `wp-codebox/wordpress-state-section/v1`: the artifact-backed full section. It
  is an object with `schema`, `version: 1`, `section`, and `data`. The `section`
  value matches the key in the export `artifacts` map and the artifact filename.

Stable `wordpress-state-section/v1` section fields are intentionally generic
WordPress state, not replay/grader semantics:

| Section | Stable fields |
| --- | --- |
| `summary` | `siteUrl`, `homeUrl`, `wordpressVersion`, `activeTheme`, `activePlugins`, `postCounts` keyed by post type and status. |
| `posts` | Array of public post types ordered by ascending `ID`. Entries include `id`, `type`, `slug`, `status`, `title`, `contentHash`, `modifiedGmt`, and `content` when `includeContent: true`. This covers posts, pages, and public custom post types. |
| `templates` | `theme`, `templates`, `templateParts`, and `globalStyles`. Template entries include `id`, `slug`, `theme`, `type`, `source`, and `contentHash`; template part entries include `id`, `slug`, `theme`, `area`, `source`, and `contentHash`; global styles expose `stylesheetHash` when available. |
| `options` | Object keyed by explicitly requested `optionNames`; no options are exported implicitly. |
| `terms` | Array of terms with `id`, `taxonomy`, `slug`, `name`, `parent`, and `count`. |
| `menus` | Array of menus with `id`, `slug`, `name`, and `items`; menu items include `id`, `title`, `url`, `parentId`, `object`, and `type`. |
| `media` | Array of attachments ordered by ascending `ID`. Entries include `id`, `slug`, `title`, `status`, `mimeType`, `sourceUrl`, `altText`, and `metadataHash`. |
| `users` | Array ordered by ascending `ID`. Entries always include `id` and `redacted`; `roles` and `caps` are allowed safe fields. Identity fields such as `user_login` and `display_name` are emitted only when requested and `redaction: "none"`. |

Redaction is part of the contract. The default `redaction: "safe"` avoids user
identity fields and requires explicit allowlists for options and users.
`redaction: "none"` is an opt-in export mode for trusted callers that need identity fields.
Consumers should verify artifact SHA-256 values before replay and should branch
on `schema` and `version` instead of projecting per-consumer legacy state shapes.

Replay is bounded to the generic runtime contract. A consumer can replay a step
by creating a compatible backend runtime, applying the same mounts/artifact
inputs, and executing the action envelope in order. WP Codebox intentionally
does not record rewards, scenario ids, benchmark metadata, model-eval fields, or
product-specific success semantics; those belong to the caller's projection of
the trace. Backend behavior still matters: command availability, WordPress
version, installed packages, mounted files, network policy, and secrets policy
must be reproduced by the replay harness.

Runtime snapshots are explicit about their semantics. The Playground backend
returns `semantics: "runtime-state-artifact"` for generic WordPress runtime
snapshots. The snapshot artifact declares `wp-codebox/wordpress-runtime-snapshot/v1`
and captures database tables, `wp-content` files, mounted input metadata, active
theme/plugins, WordPress/PHP compatibility metadata, and SHA-256 hashes. Call
`restoreRuntime(snapshot, backend, { runtime, mounts })` to restore a compatible
snapshot into a fresh runtime. The primitive is intentionally generic WordPress
state capture: caller-specific scoring, evaluation, and success semantics belong
outside WP Codebox.

`collectArtifacts({ includeRuntimeSnapshotBundles: true })` includes snapshot
artifact refs in the artifact manifest and runtime reference indexes. Consumers
should branch on the snapshot `semantics` field and verify artifact hashes before
restore or replay.

The runtime reference manifest repeats each snapshot's `semantics` and adds an
explicit `replay.status`. For Playground runtime-state artifacts that status is
`runtime-state-artifact`, with snapshot artifact refs available for restore.

## CLI Commands

### `commands`

Discover the supported runtime and recipe commands without launching Playground.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- commands --json
```

JSON output uses `wp-codebox/command-catalog/v1` and includes each command id, description, accepted args, known output shape, and runtime policy requirement. Human output is a concise command list.

### `schema recipe`

Print the JSON Schema for `wp-codebox/workspace-recipe/v1` without reading a recipe or launching Playground.
The canonical schema source is `createWorkspaceRecipeJsonSchema()` in `@automattic/wp-codebox-core`, next to the `WorkspaceRecipe` TypeScript contract; the CLI injects its current recipe command ids into that shared schema factory.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- schema recipe --json
```

The schema covers `runtime`, `inputs.mounts`, `inputs.workspaces`, `inputs.extra_plugins` / `inputs.extraPlugins`, `inputs.secretEnv`, `workflow.steps`, and `artifacts`.

### `run`

Run one command in a disposable runtime.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- run \
  --mount <host-path>:<sandbox-path>[:readonly|readwrite] \
  --command <command> \
  --arg <key=value> \
  --preview-port <local-port> \
  --preview-bind 127.0.0.1 \
  --preview-public-url <public-tunnel-url> \
  --json
```

Supported runtime commands today:

- `inspect-mounted-inputs`: list mounted input entries from inside Playground.
- `wordpress.run-php`: run PHP; accepts `code=<php>` or `code-file=<path>`.
- `wordpress.wp-cli`: run WP-CLI; accepts `command='wp option get home'` or plain args.
- `wordpress.ability`: execute a registered WordPress Ability; accepts `name=<ability>` and optional JSON `input=<object>`.
- `wordpress.phpunit`: run a mounted plugin's PHPUnit suite; accepts `plugin-slug=<slug>` (or explicit `code`/`code-file`) plus `test-file`, `autoload-file`, `tests-dir`, and `phpunit-xml`.
- `wordpress.core-phpunit`: run WordPress core's PHPUnit suite against a mounted `wordpress-develop` checkout; accepts `core-root`, `tests-dir`, `phpunit-xml`, `test-file`, `autoload-file`, and `multisite`. **Precondition:** the mounted checkout must already have Composer dev dependencies installed — see below.
- `wordpress.browser-probe`: boot the live preview, visit `url=<path-or-url>` with Playwright, and capture generic browser replay/audit evidence under `files/browser/`.
- `wordpress.browser-actions`: boot the live preview, drive it with an ordered interaction script (`steps-json`), assert browser behavior, and capture replay/audit evidence under `files/browser/`.

`wordpress.run-php` loads `/wordpress/wp-load.php` by default. Use `--arg bootstrap=none` for raw PHP.

`wordpress.wp-cli` automatically enables Playground's `wp-cli` extra library when the command is allowed by runtime policy.

`wordpress.core-phpunit` **requires the mounted `wordpress-develop` checkout to already have its Composer dev dependencies installed** before you mount it. WordPress core's `tests/phpunit/includes/bootstrap.php` hard-requires the test toolchain (PHPUnit plus the Yoast PHPUnit Polyfills at `vendor/yoast/phpunit-polyfills/phpunitpolyfills-autoload.php`) and `die()`s if it is absent — a freshly cloned `wordpress-develop` tree has **no `vendor/`**. Run `composer install` (or `composer update -W`) inside the checkout first, or mount a checkout that already has `vendor/`. WP Codebox does **not** silently fetch these dependencies for you (sandbox network downloads remain gated behind `WP_CODEBOX_ALLOW_NETWORK_DOWNLOADS=1`). When the toolchain is missing, the command now fails with a clear, structured error naming the missing paths instead of crashing with an opaque "crashed before producing a structured response" — the pre-flight check runs before core's bootstrap, and a mid-`require` `die()` is captured via output buffering + a shutdown handler so diagnostics always reach `files/core-phpunit/.pg-test-result.txt`.

`wordpress.browser-probe` accepts `wait-for=domcontentloaded|load|networkidle|selector:<selector>|duration`, `duration=<n>s`, `viewport=<width>x<height>` (for example `viewport=390x844`), `pre-page-script=<js>`, repeated `assert=<assertion>` arguments, and `capture=console,errors,html,network,performance,memory,screenshot`. Use `pre-page-script` for controlled capability mocks that page scripts must observe during startup, such as `ApplePaySession`, `PaymentRequest`, wallet availability probes, or other browser/payment feature state. The script is installed with Playwright before navigation and before application scripts run; artifact summaries preserve only its SHA-256 and byte length, not the source. Assertions support `exists:<selector>`, `not-exists:<selector>`, `visible:<selector>`, `hidden:<selector>`, `count:<selector><op><number>`, `text:<selector> contains <text>`, `attr:<selector>[name][=value]`, `no-console-errors`, `no-page-errors`, and `no-errors`; prefix with `advisory:` to record a failing assertion without failing the probe. Assertion results are included in the command JSON and `summary.json`, and non-advisory failures fail the command after artifacts are written. It records machine-readable evidence refs such as `files/browser/console.jsonl`, `files/browser/errors.jsonl`, `files/browser/network.jsonl`, `files/browser/performance.json`, `files/browser/memory.json`, `files/browser/checkpoints.jsonl`, `files/browser/snapshot.html`, `files/browser/screenshot.png`, and `files/browser/summary.json` when those captures are enabled. The summary includes requested/final URLs, effective viewport/device metadata, optional pre-page script metadata, HTML and screenshot hashes, assertion results, network event counts, optional final/peak browser memory and performance summaries, and a generic `artifact-backed|partial|diagnostic-only` replayability classification. Performance and memory captures use generic browser/CDP data only: JS heap when available, CDP `Performance.getMetrics`, CDP DOM counters, DOM/resource counts and byte totals, and long task counts/duration. Probe scripts may call `window.__wpCodeboxProbeCheckpoint(name, metadata)` when `performance` or `memory` capture is enabled to record named generic checkpoint snapshots. WP Codebox intentionally keeps these browser evidence fields generic; consumers such as eval harnesses may interpret them without WP Codebox adding scoring, grading, or benchmark semantics.

`wordpress.browser-actions` drives the preview with an ordered interaction script so Codebox can prove a plugin still *works* under interaction, not just that it renders. Pass the script as `steps-json=<array>` (inline JSON, or `@<path>` to read it from a file); the legacy `actions-json=<array>` shape is still accepted and normalized to steps. Each step is a thin, stable mapping over a Playwright locator action — this is not a test-runner DSL.

Step kinds: `navigate` (`url`, optional `waitFor=domcontentloaded|load|networkidle`), `click`/`hover` (`selector` or `text`), `fill`/`type` (`selector`, `value`), `press` (`key`, optional `selector`), `drag` (`from` selector, `to` as `{ "selector": ... }` or `{ "x": n, "y": n }`), `select` (`selector`, `value` or `values`), `waitFor` (`selector` or `waitFor=domcontentloaded|load|networkidle|duration|selector:<sel>`), `evaluate` (`expression`, optional `assert` to deep-equal the result), `expect` (`selector`, optional `state=visible|hidden|attached|detached|enabled|disabled|checked|unchecked|editable`), and `screenshot` (optional `name` for a named capture). Every step may set its own `timeout=<n>s`; the command also accepts a global `step-timeout=<n>s` (per step) and `timeout=<n>s` (total-script budget). Both are bounded and deterministic — the run stops cleanly on the first failing step, with no silent partial success.

The arbitrary-JS `evaluate` step is policy-gated **separately** from the non-JS interaction steps: a script containing `evaluate` requires `wordpress.browser-actions.evaluate` in the runtime policy in addition to `wordpress.browser-actions`. Click/fill/drag/expect and friends never require the extra grant, so a consumer can allow UI driving while still forbidding arbitrary page JS.

It records `files/browser/steps.jsonl` (per-step index, kind, selector, ok/fail, timing, and any named screenshot), `files/browser/action-summary.json` (with a machine-readable `assertions` block of `total`/`passed`/`failed` plus each `expect`/`evaluate` result), named `files/browser/screenshot-<name>.png` captures, and optional `console`, `errors`, `network`, `html`, and `screenshot` artifacts (capture defaults to `steps,console,errors,network,html,screenshot`; `actions` is accepted as an alias for `steps`). Failures identify the failed step index/kind in `steps.jsonl`, include serialized browser errors, and still write the requested audit artifacts when possible. Existing navigate-only invocations (just `url=`, no `steps-json`) behave exactly as before.

```jsonc
// steps-json: open the editor, drive the crop modal, assert it still works, capture it
[
  { "kind": "click",      "selector": "role=button[name='Social']" },
  { "kind": "waitFor",    "selector": ".reactEasyCrop_Container" },
  { "kind": "drag",       "from": ".reactEasyCrop_CropArea", "to": { "x": 40, "y": 40 } },
  { "kind": "fill",       "selector": "#caption", "value": "smoke test" },
  { "kind": "evaluate",   "expression": "document.querySelector('.crop').isConnected", "assert": true },
  { "kind": "expect",     "selector": ".crop-confirm", "state": "visible" },
  { "kind": "screenshot", "name": "after-crop" }
]
```

WP Codebox defaults to WordPress `7.0` because the agent and AI plugin stacks need the modern WordPress AI surface. Override with `--wp trunk`, `--wp nightly`, or another supported Playground version.

`--preview-port` fixes the local WP Codebox proxy port for tunnel/proxy wiring. Omit it to keep the current random-port behavior from upstream Playground. `--preview-bind` changes that fixed-port proxy bind address and requires `--preview-port`; it does not change the upstream Playground server bind. `--preview-public-url` is metadata and site-url alignment only; it does not make a loopback-only preview reachable without a tunnel/proxy or explicit proxy bind.

### `boot`

Boot a disposable Playground runtime for interactive sandbox review without running a workflow step.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- boot \
  --mount <host-path>:<sandbox-path>[:readonly|readwrite] \
  --blueprint ./playground-blueprint.json \
  --artifacts ./artifacts \
  --hold 15m \
  --preview-port 4173 \
  --preview-public-url https://example-tunnel.test/ \
  --json
```

`boot` accepts the same mount, WordPress version, policy, artifact, fixed preview port, and public preview URL setup used by the runtime commands. `--blueprint` accepts inline JSON or a path to a Playground blueprint JSON file. `--hold` uses the same duration syntax and 3600-second maximum as `run --preview-hold`.

The JSON output uses `wp-codebox/boot/v1` and includes runtime information plus the collected artifact bundle. The artifact bundle includes preview metadata, mounted-file capture, diffs, review metadata, and lifecycle logs, but no `execution` object and no fake command entry.

### `validate-blueprint`

Validate a raw WordPress Playground blueprint through WP Codebox instead of calling `@wp-playground/cli` directly.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- validate-blueprint \
  --blueprint ./playground-blueprint.json \
  --wp 7.0 \
  --artifacts ./artifacts \
  --json
```

`--blueprint` accepts inline JSON or a path to a Playground blueprint JSON file. The command boots Playground with that blueprint, captures the normal artifact bundle, and returns `wp-codebox/blueprint-validation/v1` with runtime and artifact paths. Use it in CI when the desired contract is "this blueprint boots and produces reviewable WP Codebox artifacts" rather than a recipe workflow.

### `recipe validate`

Validate a workspace recipe without launching Playground.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe validate \
  --recipe ./examples/recipes/simple-plugin.json \
  --json
```

Validation checks schema, source paths, extra plugin entrypoints, workspace seeds, supported workflow commands, JSON ability inputs, and command arguments.

Use `recipe validate` when you only need a pass/fail contract for authoring or CI. It does not resolve the execution plan beyond validation summaries.

### `recipe-run`

Run a repeatable recipe.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe-run \
  --recipe ./examples/recipes/simple-plugin.json \
  --preview-hold 15m \
  --preview-port 4173 \
  --preview-public-url https://example-tunnel.test/ \
  --json
```

Recipes are JSON declarations for a sandbox setup plus workflow steps. They can mount existing directories, create disposable plugin/theme workspaces, activate extra plugins, allow-list selected secret environment variable names, and capture the output as artifacts.

Pass `--dry-run --json` to validate the same recipe and emit the resolved plan without booting Playground, creating temp workspaces, mounting files, executing commands, or writing artifacts:

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe-run \
  --recipe ./examples/recipes/simple-plugin.json \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

Dry-run output uses `wp-codebox/recipe-run-dry-run/v1` and includes resolved mounts, planned workspaces, extra plugins, workflow steps with parsed and resolved command args, allowed secret environment variable names without values, and per-step policy status. Use `recipe-run` without `--dry-run` when you want the real Playground-backed execution and artifact bundle.

`inputs.extra_plugins` accepts existing local plugin directory paths and external HTTPS zip sources. Local paths keep the existing behavior: they are resolved relative to the recipe file and mounted read-only under `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/<slug>`.

Set `loadAs` to `mu-plugin` for runtime substrate that should load as must-use infrastructure instead of appearing as a normal user-managed plugin. WP Codebox mounts those plugins under `/wordpress/wp-content/mu-plugins/wp-codebox-runtime/<slug>` and writes a `wp-codebox-runtime-loader.php` setup loader. Use this for sandbox/runtime plumbing such as Agents API, Data Machine, Data Machine Code, and AI provider bridges. Leave user-visible site plugins as the default `plugin` load mode.

Browser Playground callers can provide sandbox-owned MU plugin source through `runtime.mu_plugins` on `wp-codebox/create-browser-playground-session`. Those files are written into `/wordpress/wp-content/mu-plugins/` before the generated runner invokes sandbox-local work. Pair that with `browser_runner.invocation` to call a generic sandbox extension point:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "mu_plugins": [
      {
        "slug": "caller-runtime",
        "file": "caller-runtime.php",
        "content": "<?php add_filter( 'caller_runtime_task', static function ( $result, $input ) { return array( 'summary' => 'done', 'input' => $input ); }, 10, 2 );"
      }
    ]
  },
  "browser_runner": {
    "capture_paths": [
      {
        "path": "/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wp-codebox/artifacts/materialization/report.json",
        "name": "materialization-report",
        "kind": "report",
        "mime_type": "application/json",
        "max_bytes": 262144
      }
    ],
    "invocation": {
      "type": "task",
      "hook": "caller_runtime_task",
      "input": {
        "diagnostics": { "status": "ready" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`browser_runner.invocation.type` supports `ability` for a `namespace/name` WordPress Ability and `task` for a caller-owned WordPress hook. WP Codebox validates the invocation shape, runs it inside the disposable Playground only, and returns normal artifact metadata without encoding product-specific repair semantics.

The packaged browser runtime exposes `window.wpCodeboxBrowser.runBrowserSessionRecipe( client, sessionOutput, taskPayload?, options? )` for executing the `wp-codebox/create-browser-playground-session` response. Pass the full ability output as `sessionOutput`; WP Codebox resolves `sessionOutput.recipe`, stages `taskPayload` or `sessionOutput.task_input` at the recipe's browser task path, runs the generated PHP request step through Playground, and returns the parsed runner result. Product callers should use this helper instead of reading `recipe.workflow.steps` or extracting `code=` arguments themselves.

`browser_runner.capture_paths` is the generic result-capture layer for browser materialization. Each entry names a sandbox-local file that the generated runner should read after the ability or hook returns. The runner writes `/tmp/wp-codebox-agent-result.json` with `wp-codebox/browser-materialization/v1`, normalized `success`/`status`/`error` fields, invocation metadata, the raw response, and captured files as `wp-codebox/browser-capture/v1` records. JSON files are decoded into `json`, text files into `content`, and binary files into `content_base64`, bounded by `max_bytes`.

External sources are explicit and CI-safe. WP Codebox validates URL-shaped sources before Playground boots, but it downloads them only when `WP_CODEBOX_ALLOW_NETWORK_DOWNLOADS=1` is set. Supported first-slice forms are WordPress.org plugin zip URLs and generic HTTPS `.zip` URLs:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "extraPlugins": [
      {
        "source": "https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/bbpress.latest-stable.zip",
        "pluginFile": "bbpress/bbpress.php",
        "activate": false
      },
      {
        "source": "https://example.com/acme-helper.zip",
        "slug": "acme-helper",
        "pluginFile": "acme-helper/acme-helper.php"
      },
      {
        "source": "../agents-api",
        "slug": "agents-api",
        "pluginFile": "agents-api/agents-api.php",
        "activate": false,
        "loadAs": "mu-plugin"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

WordPress.org plugin zip URLs infer the plugin slug from the zip filename. Generic HTTPS zip sources require `slug` so the sandbox mount target is deterministic. Dry-run plans and artifact provenance record the original source reference, resolved URL, source kind, and SHA-256 digest when a download occurs; temporary download paths are reported by category rather than as durable host paths.

`inputs.siteSeeds` supports bounded sandbox setup data before workflow steps run. Local `fixture` seeds import JSON objects with scoped `posts`, `terms`, `options`, anonymized `users`, media metadata, `activePlugins`, and `activeTheme`. Every record scope must be explicit through selectors and/or `maxRecords`; option scopes require a `names` allow-list; parent-site users are anonymized; media file bytes are not replayed.

The WordPress host ability also accepts `site_seeds` entries with `type: "parent_site"`. That path is opt-in: the host exports only the requested current-site scopes into a temporary JSON fixture, invokes `recipe-run`, then deletes the fixture. This is a bounded seed substrate, not a full migration engine. It does not replay full database state, comments, revisions, arbitrary meta, uploads, secrets, or source-site filesystem state.

Reprint remains a future backend candidate for full/essential parent-site snapshots. WP Codebox does not vendor or shell out to Reprint for bounded `siteSeeds` yet because Reprint is a site-scale migration engine, while this contract needs explicit per-scope limits and privacy defaults.

Mount entries may include opaque `metadata` that is preserved in runtime observations, artifact provenance, and captured mount files. Product-specific callers can use this to map sandbox paths back to source repositories without WP Codebox knowing about the caller's deployment environment:

```json
{
  "source": "/srv/site/wp-content/plugins/example",
  "target": "/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/example",
  "mode": "readwrite",
  "metadata": {
    "kind": "component",
    "slug": "example-plugin",
    "repo": "org/example-plugin",
    "default_branch": "main",
    "repo_root_relative_to_mount": ".",
    "editable": true
  }
}
```

Example recipes:

- `examples/recipes/simple-plugin.json`: mount and probe the fixture plugin.
- `examples/recipes/wp-cli.json`: prove WP-CLI commands mutate the same runtime observed by later steps.
- `examples/recipes/seeded-plugin-workspace.json`: create a disposable plugin scaffold, mutate it, and capture diffs.
- `examples/recipes/datamachine-agent-bundle.json`: mount Agents API and Data Machine, then import a bundle through `wordpress.ability`.
- `examples/recipes/cookbook/headless-browser-agent-task.json`: generic headless browser-agent pattern with browser probes before/after a sandbox agent task, browser action assertions, screenshots, transcript, and artifact evidence.
- `examples/recipes/cookbook/multisite-network.json`: convert Playground to multisite, mount a plugin under test, seed two child sites, and emit network/site/admin URLs.
- `examples/recipes/cookbook/woocommerce-store.json`: realistic WooCommerce dependency shape with seeded store pages, products, customer, and order fixtures.
- `examples/recipes/cookbook/theme-block-editor.json`: realistic theme/block-editor smoke surface with a mounted theme, seeded block page, and frontend/editor/admin URLs.
- `examples/recipes/cookbook/seeded-content.json`: realistic fixture content shape with pages, posts, categories, tags, editor/author users, and preview/admin URLs.
- `examples/recipes/cookbook/bbpress-reply-editor.json`: realistic bbPress dependency shape with a seeded forum/topic and reply form.

#### Generic Headless Browser-Agent Recipe

`examples/recipes/cookbook/headless-browser-agent-task.json` is the reusable
shape for product runners that need a headless browser plus an in-sandbox agent
task without importing product semantics into WP Codebox:

1. Mount or install the generic runtime dependencies and any code under test.
2. Capture a browser baseline with `wordpress.browser-probe`.
3. Run `wp-codebox.agent-sandbox-run` with caller-supplied `task=...` and either a real sandbox agent (`agent=...`, `provider=...`, `model=...`) or a recipe-owned `code-file=...` for deterministic fixtures.
4. Use `wordpress.browser-actions` to replay browser interactions, assert visible behavior, and capture named screenshots.
5. Capture a final `wordpress.browser-probe` so the artifact bundle contains before/after browser evidence, action steps, screenshots, transcript, and `agent-result.json`.

Run the example headlessly:

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe-run \
  --recipe ./examples/recipes/cookbook/headless-browser-agent-task.json \
  --artifacts ./artifacts \
  --json
```

Product eval runners should treat the returned `wp-codebox/recipe-run/v1` output
and artifact bundle as generic evidence. WP Codebox records runtime commands,
browser observations, screenshots, transcript, changed files, patch summary, and
review metadata; callers own scenario ids, scoring, grading, model comparison,
retry policy, and product reports outside the WP Codebox contract.

Supported workspace seeds:

- `plugin_scaffold`: creates `<slug>.php` and `README.md`, mounted by default at `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/<slug>`.
- `theme_scaffold`: creates `style.css`, `index.php`, and `README.md`, mounted by default at `/wordpress/wp-content/themes/<slug>`.
- `directory`: copies `seed.source` into a disposable workspace and requires an explicit sandbox `target`.

### Bench Recipes

Run `wordpress.bench` from a recipe workflow to execute plugin `tests/bench/*.php` workloads in a disposable WP Codebox runtime and emit a normalized benchmark results envelope.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe-run \
  --recipe ./examples/recipes/bench-plugin.json \
  --json
```

Each workload file returns a callable. The callable may return numeric metrics directly or a payload with `metrics` and `metadata` keys. The recipe output reports duration percentiles, custom metric aggregates, peak memory, runtime artifacts, and the parsed `benchResults` object in JSON output when a single `wordpress.bench` step runs. If earlier `wordpress.browser-probe` steps in the same recipe captured generic `performance` or `memory` artifacts, `wordpress.bench` promotes selected numeric browser values into each scenario's metrics using `browser_*` names, while the raw browser artifacts remain available under `files/browser/`.

Use `bench summarize` to extract a stable automation envelope from saved `recipe-run --json` output:

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- bench summarize \
  --input ./artifacts/bench-plugin/recipe-run.json \
  --json
```

Use `artifacts bench-results` to extract benchmark results from an artifact bundle command log:

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- artifacts bench-results \
  --bundle ./artifacts/bench-plugin \
  --json
```

See [`docs/benchmark-contract.md`](docs/benchmark-contract.md) for the generic benchmark contract, result shape, artifact/provenance expectations, and the boundary between WP Codebox responsibilities and caller-owned scoring or product semantics.

### `agent-runtime-probe`

Boot a sandbox with Agents API, Data Machine, and Data Machine Code mounted, then verify the stack loads.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- agent-runtime-probe \
  --agents-api ../agents-api \
  --data-machine ../data-machine \
  --data-machine-code ../data-machine-code \
  --json
```

### `agent-sandbox-run`

Run one natural-language task through a sandboxed agent stack.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- agent-sandbox-run \
  --agents-api ../agents-api \
  --data-machine ../data-machine \
  --data-machine-code ../data-machine-code \
  --agent sandbox-agent \
  --task "Add a Dry Rub filter to the wing locations map" \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-5.5 \
  --json
```

Useful options:

- `--provider-plugin <path>`: mount an AI provider plugin. Repeatable.
- `--secret-env <NAME>`: expose a parent process environment variable by name, such as `--secret-env GITHUB_TOKEN`. Repeatable. Values are read from the process environment and are not accepted in JSON payloads.
- `--mount <host:vfs[:mode]>`: mount extra task inputs.
- `--session-id <id>`: continue an existing sandbox conversation session.
- `--max-turns <n>`: bound the agent loop.

`--code` and `--code-file` still exist on the CLI for operator/debug use after the agent stack boots. They are not accepted by the parent-site `wp-codebox/run-agent-task` ability.

### `agent-sandbox-batch`

Run several task descriptions, one isolated sandbox per task, with bounded concurrency.

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- agent-sandbox-batch \
  --agents-api ../agents-api \
  --data-machine ../data-machine \
  --data-machine-code ../data-machine-code \
  --task "Fix issue A" \
  --task "Investigate issue B" \
  --concurrency 2 \
  --json
```

Use `--tasks-json` or `--tasks-file` when the task list is generated by another system.

## Artifact Bundles

Artifact capture is owned by WP Codebox because WP Codebox knows what was mounted, what executed, and what must survive teardown.

Current bundles include:

- `manifest.json`: artifact index with content types and the content digest used for the bundle id.
- `metadata.json`: runtime, policy, mounts, and caller metadata.
- `blueprint.after.json`: partial WordPress Playground replay blueprint for captured text files.
- `blueprint.after-notes.json`: replay limitations and next capture targets.
- `events.jsonl`, `commands.jsonl`, `observations.jsonl`: runtime evidence streams.
- `logs/runtime.log`, `logs/commands.log`: human-readable logs.
- `files/mounts.json`: mounted input list.
- `files/mounted-files.json`: captured readwrite mount files with size, SHA-256, target path, and replayability metadata.
- `files/changed-files.json`: canonical changed-files manifest for review and apply-back consumers.
- `files/patch.diff`: canonical combined text patch for changed readwrite mounts that declare a baseline.
- `files/test-results.json`: normalized test-results artifact with schema, summary counts, suites, and raw log references. When WP Codebox has not run test-aware commands, the artifact is present with `status: "unknown"`, zero counts, an empty `suites` array, and pointers to raw command logs instead of inferred pass/fail data.
- `files/review.json`: frontend-oriented review payload with summary, progress labels, changed file labels, evidence links, and approval actions.
- `files/runtime-reference-manifest.json`: stable runtime ref index with artifact-bundle, file, trace/events, and snapshot refs plus SHA-256 digests.
- `files/diffs.json`: diff index for readwrite mounts that declare a baseline.
- `files/diffs/<mount>.patch`: unified text diff from a seeded baseline to the sandbox output.
- `files/mounts/<index>/...`: copied file contents from readwrite mounts.

`metadata.json` points to the canonical changed-files, patch, test-results, review, and mount-diff artifact paths under `artifacts`. It also includes `provenance` derived from data WP Codebox already has: task input/context where available, WP Codebox runtime version, WordPress version, mounted component/mount metadata, and agent/provider/model fields passed to the sandbox runner. `files/diffs/<mount>.patch` remains available for per-mount detail; `files/patch.diff` is the combined review/apply-back patch surface.

### `files/test-results.json`

`files/test-results.json` is the normalized contract for future test-aware commands. The artifact exists even when no command produced structured test output, so artifact consumers can read one stable path and treat `status: "unknown"` as "no structured test result was captured."

```json
{
  "schema": "wp-codebox/test-results/v1",
  "status": "unknown",
  "summary": { "total": 0, "passed": 0, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0, "unknown": 0 },
  "suites": [],
  "rawLogReferences": [
    { "path": "commands.jsonl", "kind": "commands-jsonl" },
    { "path": "logs/commands.log", "kind": "commands-log" }
  ]
}
```

Artifact bundle ids are content-addressed for the apply-back contract. The runtime writes `manifest.id` as `artifact-bundle-sha256-<digest>`, where `<digest>` is SHA-256 over the exact bytes of `files/changed-files.json` and `files/patch.diff` with the `wp-codebox/artifact-content/v1` domain separator. The same value is exposed as `manifest.contentDigest.value`, `metadata.contentDigest.value`, the CLI `artifacts.contentDigest` field, and `files/review.json` evidence. Approval and apply-back consumers must recompute it before trusting an approved artifact.

Every `manifest.files[]` entry also carries `sha256: { "algorithm": "sha256", "value": "..." }`. For regular files, `value` is the SHA-256 of that artifact file's bytes. For `manifest.json`, `value` is a canonical self-hash over the parsed manifest with the manifest entry's own hash replaced by 64 zeroes, using the `wp-codebox/artifact-manifest-self/v1` domain separator. `wp-codebox artifacts verify` rejects missing hashes and mismatched hashes for any declared file, so tampering with replay-critical or supporting artifacts is detected even when the top-level content digest inputs are unchanged.

`wp-codebox artifacts verify` also fails closed on unsafe bundle topology: all
declared file paths must be bundle-relative, non-duplicated, traversal-free,
listed in `manifest.files[]` when used as digest inputs or evidence refs, and
present as regular files under the bundle directory. Symlinks, special files, and
regular files with multiple hard links are rejected so downstream consumers do
not trust artifact evidence that may alias protected content outside the bundle.

### `files/review.json`

`files/review.json` is the frontend contract for chat and owner review flows. It is derived from canonical artifacts and should be safe for a generic frontend to render without parsing unified diffs.

```json
{
  "schema": "wp-codebox/artifact-review/v1",
  "artifactId": "artifact-bundle-...",
  "provenance": {
    "task": { "kind": "agent-sandbox-run", "input": "Add a Dry Rub filter..." },
    "runtime": {
      "backend": "wordpress-playground",
      "version": "0.0.0",
      "wordpressVersion": "7.0"
    },
    "agent": { "agent": "sandbox-agent", "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5.5" },
    "mounts": [
      {
        "type": "directory",
        "source": "/path/to/data-machine-code",
        "target": "/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/data-machine-code",
        "mode": "readonly",
        "metadata": { "kind": "component", "slug": "data-machine-code" }
      }
    ]
  },
  "summary": "Sandbox produced changes in 1 file.",
  "stats": { "added": 1, "modified": 0, "deleted": 0, "total": 1 },
  "changedFiles": [
    {
      "path": "/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/example/generated.txt",
      "status": "added",
      "label": "added generated.txt",
      "mountTarget": "/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/example",
      "relativePath": "generated.txt"
    }
  ],
  "progress": [
    { "type": "boot", "label": "Spinning up a test copy of your site..." },
    { "type": "artifact", "label": "Saving the result for review..." },
    { "type": "complete", "label": "Ready for your review." }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "kind": "approve", "label": "Approve all changes", "requiresApprovedFiles": true },
    { "kind": "approve-files", "label": "Approve selected files", "requiresApprovedFiles": true },
    { "kind": "discard", "label": "Discard changes" },
    { "kind": "iterate", "label": "Request changes" }
  ],
  "evidence": {
    "patch": "files/patch.diff",
    "patchSha256": "...",
    "artifactContentDigest": "...",
    "changedFiles": "files/changed-files.json",
    "testResults": "files/test-results.json"
  },
  "riskFlags": []
}
```

Review actions are declarative. Frontends call `wp-codebox/apply-approved-artifact` with `artifact_id` and an explicit `approved_files[]` list for approve actions, call `wp-codebox/discard-artifact` for discard, and start a new sandbox task for iterate/request-changes flows.

Browser preview sessions can reuse the core browser review bridge instead of inventing product-specific postMessage contracts. Pass sandbox-visible metadata with schema `wp-codebox/browser-review-bridge/v1` and at least `artifactId`; include `sessionId`, `provenance`, `contentDigest`, `approvedFiles`, `applyTarget`, `requester`, and `context` when the parent needs audit or apply-back correlation. The bridge posts decisions to the parent as `{ type: "wp-codebox:artifact-review-decision", payload }`, where `payload.schema` is `wp-codebox/browser-review-decision/v1` and includes the action, artifact/session identifiers, approved files, provenance/content digest, apply target, approver/reason, and merged context.

Products can render their own UI and call `postBrowserReviewDecision()`, or use the small default overlay from `renderBrowserReviewOverlay()` with caller-supplied labels. Keep product copy outside Codebox by setting labels in metadata. Parent hosts that receive an approve decision can pass `artifactId`, `approvedFiles`, `approver`, `applyTarget`, and `context` into `wp-codebox/stage-artifact-apply`, preserving the existing Data Machine pending-action review path before `apply-approved-artifact` resolves the approved artifact.

Binary files and oversized files are copied when allowed by capture limits but are not embedded into `blueprint.after.json`. Database exports, option diffs, uploaded media, active plugin/theme state, screenshots, parsed test command output, and redaction guarantees are still future artifact targets.

## WordPress Plugin

The WordPress plugin registers parent-site abilities:

- `wp-codebox/run-agent-task`
- `wp-codebox/run-agent-task-batch`
- `wp-codebox/list-artifacts`
- `wp-codebox/get-artifact`
- `wp-codebox/discard-artifact`
- `wp-codebox/apply-approved-artifact`
- `wp-codebox/stage-artifact-apply`

Canonical agent-task execution paths are intentionally split by caller runtime:

- Server/host execution uses `wp-codebox/run-agent-task` or `wp-codebox/run-agent-task-batch`. These abilities shell out to local `wp-codebox recipe-run`, boot disposable Playground sandboxes, mount the configured agent stack, invoke the sandbox agent through `agents/chat`, and return artifact metadata.
- Portable CLI execution uses `wp-codebox recipe-run --recipe <path>`. Recipes use the `wp-codebox.agent-sandbox-run` helper step when they need the agent-task bridge; direct `agent-sandbox-run` remains an operator/debug command, not the product API for frontend callers.
- No-Node/browser execution uses `wp-codebox/create-browser-playground-session`. The host prepares a browser-executable Playground recipe and runner payload; the browser executes `wordpress.run-php` inside Playground instead of requiring host shell or Node access.

All three paths use the same `wp-codebox/task-input/v1` task input contract. Host and browser paths also emit the same `wp-codebox/sandbox-session/v1` session envelope so product callers can correlate prepared browser sessions and completed host runs without transport-specific metadata drift.

`wp-codebox/run-agent-task-batch` runs one isolated sandbox per task sequentially and returns per-task status, artifact id, preview URL, and error fields. Parent orchestrators own any parallel fan-out above this ability.

`wp-codebox/run-agent-task` accepts the stable task input contract below. Existing callers that still send `task` as a string are normalized to the same shape with `goal` populated from `task`. It rejects raw `code` and `code_file` fields so frontend/chat callers cannot pass arbitrary PHP through the product ability path. Operators can still use CLI debug commands directly when they need raw PHP probes.

```json
{
  "schema": "wp-codebox/task-input/v1",
  "goal": "Add a focused product feature and return a reviewable patch.",
  "target": {
    "kind": "plugin",
    "path": "wp-content/plugins/example"
  },
  "allowed_tools": ["workspace.read", "workspace.write", "tests.run"],
  "expected_artifacts": ["patch", "tests", "review"],
  "policy": {
    "applyBack": "reviewed"
  },
  "context": {
    "issue": "https://github.com/Automattic/wp-codebox/issues/29"
  }
}
```

`target.kind` is caller-defined but should use `repo`, `site`, `plugin`, or `theme` when possible. `allowed_tools` and `expected_artifacts` are advisory contract fields for the product caller and sandboxed agent loop; the host runner still decides the private CLI invocation and returns the normalized `task_input` alongside the string `task` it passed into the current CLI bridge.

Component paths can come from ability input, the `wp_codebox_component_paths` option, or the `wp_codebox_component_paths` filter.

Product callers can opt into public preview wiring through `preview_port`, `preview_bind`, and `preview_public_url`. Omit them to keep the default loopback-only random-port preview behavior; `preview_bind` requires `preview_port`, and `preview_public_url` must be an `http` or `https` URL.

Expected component keys:

- `agents_api`
- `data_machine`
- `data_machine_code`
- `provider_plugins` (optional list)

The CLI binary can come from ability input, the `wp_codebox_bin` option, or the `wp_codebox_bin` filter.

Data Machine Code is a mounted coding-tools component inside the sandbox. It provides workspace/file/GitHub tools to the sandboxed agent. WP Codebox owns the parent-site ability surface, sandbox lifecycle, and artifact capture boundary.

Parent orchestrators that already own task state can call the same API instead of generating a low-level WP Codebox recipe. The stable CLI entry point is:

```bash
wp-codebox agent-task-run --input-file=/path/to/request.json --json
```

For Homeboy executor integration, `request.json` may use this shape:

```json
{
  "schema": "wp-codebox/task-input/v1",
  "goal": "Fix the failing audit finding and return a reviewable artifact.",
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-5.5",
  "provider_plugin_paths": ["/srv/runtime/ai-provider-for-openai"],
  "secret_env": ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],
  "mounts": [
    {
      "source": "/srv/worktrees/plugin",
      "target": "/workspace/plugin",
      "mode": "readwrite",
      "metadata": { "kind": "component", "slug": "plugin" }
    }
  ],
  "runtime_stack_mounts": [
    { "source": "/srv/runtime/agents-api", "target": "/runtime/agents-api", "mode": "readonly" }
  ],
  "runtime_overlays": [
    { "id": "data-machine-code", "source": "/srv/runtime/data-machine-code" }
  ],
  "task_timeout_seconds": 3600,
  "max_turns": 8,
  "sandbox_session_id": "homeboy-sandbox-session-123",
  "artifacts_path": "/srv/artifacts/homeboy/agent-task-123",
  "expected_artifacts": ["patch"],
  "policy": { "kind": "audit-remediation" },
  "context": { "issue": "https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123" },
  "orchestrator": {
    "type": "homeboy",
    "id": "homeboy-agent-task",
    "job_id": "homeboy-job-123",
    "agent_task_id": "agent-task-123"
  }
}
```

WP Codebox normalizes the task input, writes the private temporary recipe, runs `wp-codebox recipe-run`, then deletes temporary recipe/seed files. The JSON response keeps `schema: "wp-codebox/agent-task-run/v1"` and includes stable top-level `status`, `session`, `artifacts`, `diagnostics`, `evidence_refs`, `run_metadata`, `completion_outcome`, and raw `run` fields. Secret values are never accepted in the request or returned in the response; `secret_env` carries names only.

Consumers that need a stable interpretation layer can import `normalizeAgentTaskRunResult()` from `@automattic/wp-codebox-core`. It accepts the current `agent-task-run` response and compatibility aliases from older orchestrator integrations, including `agentResult`, `agent_result`, `completionOutcome`, `completion_outcome`, and nested `metadata.recipe_run` records. The returned `wp-codebox/agent-task-run-result/v1` envelope normalizes `completed`/`success` into `succeeded` or `failed`, exposes terminal statuses such as `no_op`, `timeout`, `provider_error`, and `unable_to_remediate`, groups artifact bundle, changed-files, patch, transcript, log, and runtime refs, and includes no-op/failure metadata for parent schedulers.

Apply-back is intentionally not part of `run-agent-task`. Sandbox execution returns proposed outputs and evidence. `list-artifacts`, `get-artifact`, and `discard-artifact` manage captured artifact bundles under the configured artifact root. `apply-approved-artifact` is the lower-level adapter/test API: it validates `artifact_id` plus an explicit `approved_files[]` list against canonical `changed-files.json`, recomputes the artifact content digest from `changed-files.json` and the exact `patch.diff` the reviewer approved, delegates to the `wp_codebox_apply_approved_artifact` filter, and requires the adapter to return `wp-codebox/apply-result/v1`. PR creation, direct deploy, package export, and bot identity policy live in adapters behind that reviewed boundary.

When Data Machine is present, prefer `stage-artifact-apply` for user-facing apply flows. It stages that same apply input as a Data Machine pending action with kind `wp_codebox_apply_back`. Its preview includes `files/review.json`, canonical changed files, normalized test results, and the explicit approved file list. Accepting the pending action resolves through Data Machine's generic resolver and calls the existing `apply-approved-artifact` path; rejecting it leaves the artifact untouched. This keeps approval lifecycle in Data Machine without making WP Codebox depend on any site-specific apply adapter.

## Runtime Policy

`RuntimePolicy` declares the intended sandbox boundary and command allow-list.

```ts
const policy = {
  network: "deny",
  filesystem: "readwrite-mounts",
  commands: ["wordpress.run-php"],
  secrets: "none",
  approvals: "never",
}
```

Current enforcement:

| Field | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `commands` | Enforced by `assertRuntimeCommandAllowed()` before backend execution. |
| `network` | Shape validated; real network enforcement is backend/control-plane work. |
| `filesystem` | Shape validated; mount/write enforcement is backend/control-plane work. |
| `secrets` | Shape validated; selected env var injection is allow-list based today. |
| `approvals` | Shape validated; product approval UX is still separate work. |

## Boundaries

WP Codebox is an embeddable sandbox/runtime API, not a product control plane and
not a WordPress-only application. It is WordPress-compatible, with a WordPress
plugin ability surface for host sites, but the core contract should also make
sense when driven by CLIs, CI jobs, hosted services, or other external agents.
Product orchestrators may drive WP Codebox through its ability surface, pass
caller-owned session/orchestrator metadata, and choose product artifact paths,
but those consumers must not leak into WP Codebox defaults.

WP Codebox owns:

- Disposable runtime lifecycle.
- Mounting inputs into Playground.
- Controlled command execution.
- Runtime event and artifact capture.
- Parent-site ability surface for launching sandbox tasks.

WP Codebox does not own:

- Agent identity, sessions, or model loop internals. Agents API and Data Machine own those.
- Model provider authentication. Provider plugins and parent control planes own credentials.
- Production mutation or deploy. Apply-back must be separate and reviewed.
- CI/eval orchestration. Parent control planes and other consumers can invoke WP Codebox; Homeboy is one example orchestrator.
- Frontend review UX. WP Codebox should produce renderable artifacts for those UIs.

## Near-Term Gaps

- Define redaction guarantees.
- Wire parent orchestrators to the external sandbox session contract for durable lifecycle, retention, quotas, cancellation, and audit records.
- Define reviewed apply-back adapters for bot-authored PRs, direct apply, and package export.
- Add visual previews, parsed test command output, and richer risk flags to frontend review payloads.

## Development Notes

- Keep the runtime contract consumer-agnostic. Parent control planes and mounted tools consume WP Codebox; they do not own the core artifact contract. Examples include Homeboy as an orchestrator and wp-gym as an evaluation implementation.
- Prefer small seams: runtime lifecycle, command handlers, artifact capture, recipes, WordPress integration, and apply-back should stay separate.
- When adding a new command or artifact type, update this README and `npm run check`.
