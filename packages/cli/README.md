# WP Codebox CLI

CLI entrypoint for running disposable WP Codebox sandboxes and collecting
reviewable artifact bundles.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @chubes4/wp-codebox-cli
wp-codebox --help
```

The package exposes the `wp-codebox` binary and includes the compiled
`dist/` entrypoint only. Build from source with `npm run build` before running
local package validation.

## Smoke

```bash
npm run build
npm run package-distribution-smoke
```

The distribution smoke runs `npm pack --dry-run --json` and verifies the package
contains `package.json`, `README.md`, and the compiled CLI entrypoint used by the
published binary.
