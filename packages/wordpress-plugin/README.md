# WP Codebox WordPress Plugin

Registers the WordPress ability surface for launching isolated WP Codebox
agent sandboxes from a parent site. The sandbox may produce WordPress-specific
or non-WordPress artifacts; the plugin returns the artifact bundle metadata to
the parent control plane for review, replay, or apply-back.

## Ability

- `wp-codebox/run-agent-task`
- `wp-codebox/run-agent-task-batch`
- `wp-codebox/list-artifacts`
- `wp-codebox/get-artifact`
- `wp-codebox/discard-artifact`
- `wp-codebox/apply-approved-artifact`
- `wp-codebox/stage-artifact-apply`

The ability runs `wp-codebox agent-sandbox-run`, which boots a disposable
WordPress Playground runtime, mounts the agent stack components, invokes the
configured sandbox agent through the canonical `agents/chat` ability, and returns
artifact metadata.

The task ability accepts `wp-codebox/task-input/v1` fields: `goal`, `target`,
`allowed_tools`, `expected_artifacts`, `policy`, and `context`. Legacy callers
may still pass `task` as a string; the runner normalizes it into `goal` and
returns the normalized `task_input` in the ability response. Raw PHP `code` and
`code_file` fields remain rejected on this product ability path.

```json
{
  "schema": "wp-codebox/task-input/v1",
  "goal": "Fix the failing settings save flow.",
  "target": { "kind": "plugin", "path": "wp-content/plugins/example" },
  "allowed_tools": ["workspace.read", "workspace.write", "tests.run"],
  "expected_artifacts": ["patch", "tests", "review"],
  "policy": { "applyBack": "reviewed" },
  "context": { "issue": "https://github.com/chubes4/wp-codebox/issues/29" }
}
```

The batch ability runs `wp-codebox agent-sandbox-batch`, accepts a list of task
descriptions or structured task inputs, and launches one isolated sandbox per
task with bounded concurrency. This is the parent-site primitive for fan-out
workflows such as assigning several GitHub issues to separate sandbox coding
agents.

Both abilities accept optional `provider` and `model` fields. These seed the
disposable sandbox's Data Machine agent configuration for the selected execution
mode. Provider plugins are supplied with `provider_plugin_paths`; WP Codebox
mounts and activates them without knowing provider-specific behavior. Provider
credentials continue to resolve through the provider's normal scoped mechanism.
Pass `secret_env` as a list of environment variable names to expose selected
parent process credentials inside the sandbox; values are read from the process
environment and are not accepted in the ability payload. For example, pass
`"secret_env": ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]` after the host process has `GITHUB_TOKEN` in
its environment; do not pass token values through ability input.

Callers may also pass an `inherit` declaration to request parent-environment
connectors or settings by name:

```json
{
  "inherit": {
    "connectors": ["primary-ai"],
    "settings": ["mode_models"]
  }
}
```

The parent site resolves that declaration through the
`wp_codebox_resolve_inheritance` filter. The resolver may return connector
status, `provider`, `model`, and `secret_env` names. WP Codebox records the
requested names and sanitized resolution status in the generated recipe/artifact
metadata and merges inherited `secret_env` names into the sandbox secret-env
allowlist. Secret values and setting values are not serialized into recipe JSON,
artifact metadata, logs, or patches by this transport slice.

Product callers may pass `mounts` to add editable or readonly host directories
to the generated recipe. Each mount may include opaque `metadata` such as
`repo`, `default_branch`, `repo_root_relative_to_mount`, and `editable` so tools
inside the sandbox can map changed sandbox paths back to source repositories.
WP Codebox preserves the metadata but does not interpret product-specific repo
topology.

For browser review, callers may pass `preview_hold_seconds` to keep the live
Playground runtime available after artifact capture. The ability response's
`run.artifacts.preview.url` and the artifact's `files/review.json` `preview`
field point at the same live URL until the hold window expires. Without a hold
window, the preview field is still recorded as evidence but marked
`expired-on-completion` because the sandbox is destroyed when the command exits.

Returned artifact metadata includes the runtime manifest, replay blueprint,
after-state notes, captured readwrite mount index, event streams, and logs. WP
Codebox owns this capture boundary so the parent site can discard the disposable
sandbox while keeping durable evidence and outputs.

## Apply-Back Approval

Apply-back is a reviewed artifact flow, not part of sandbox execution.
`wp-codebox/apply-approved-artifact` validates the requested `artifact_id`, the
explicit `approved_files[]` list, and the artifact content digest before handing
the exact approved `files/patch.diff` to the `wp_codebox_apply_approved_artifact`
adapter filter.

When Data Machine is installed, `wp-codebox/stage-artifact-apply` stages the same
apply input as a Data Machine pending action with kind `wp_codebox_apply_back`.
The pending action preview includes `files/review.json`, canonical changed files,
normalized test results, and the approved file list. Accepting the pending action
calls the registered handler, which delegates back to
`wp-codebox/apply-approved-artifact`; rejecting it leaves the artifact untouched.

Without Data Machine pending actions, `stage-artifact-apply` fails closed with
`wp_codebox_datamachine_pending_actions_missing`. Direct reviewed apply remains
available through `apply-approved-artifact` for hosts that provide their own
approval surface.

## Configuration

Component paths can be supplied by ability input, the
`wp_codebox_component_paths` option, or the `wp_codebox_component_paths`
filter. On multisite, WP Codebox reads `wp_codebox_component_paths` from network
options because component paths are host-level configuration.

Expected component keys:

- `agents_api`
- `data_machine`
- `data_machine_code`
- `provider_plugins` (optional list)

The CLI binary can be supplied by ability input, the `wp_codebox_bin` option,
or the `wp_codebox_bin` filter. On multisite, WP Codebox reads `wp_codebox_bin`
from network options because the binary path is host-level configuration.

The artifact root can be supplied per request with `artifacts_path`, by the
`wp_codebox_artifacts_root` option, or by the `wp_codebox_artifacts_root`
filter. On multisite, WP Codebox reads `wp_codebox_artifacts_root` from network
options.

## Package Artifact

Build the installable plugin zip from the repository root:

```bash
npm run package:wordpress-plugin
```

The generated artifact is `packages/wordpress-plugin/dist/wp-codebox.zip`. It
contains a single top-level `wp-codebox/` directory with `wp-codebox.php`, this
README, and the `src/` PHP files. Generated build outputs and package metadata
are intentionally excluded from the plugin zip.

Validate the artifact shape with:

```bash
npm run package-distribution-smoke
```

## Boundary

Data Machine Code is the mounted coding-tools component for file-editing agent
sandboxes. It provides workspace/file/GitHub tools inside the isolated runtime.
This plugin owns the parent-site ability surface and sandbox lifecycle boundary;
DMC does not own that control plane.

Data Machine, Data Machine Code, Homeboy Extensions, wp-gym, and other systems
are consumers or mounted tools. They do not own WP Codebox's artifact contract.
