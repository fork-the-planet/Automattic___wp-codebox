# Architecture Vision

WP Codebox is the portable sandbox boundary for WordPress coding-agent work. It
lets a parent product start a disposable WordPress Playground runtime, mount the
target code and agent stack, collect reviewable artifacts, then apply or discard
those artifacts outside the sandbox.

```text
Parent control plane
  owns users, auth, durable jobs, review UX, and apply-back policy
    -> WP Codebox
      owns sandbox lifecycle, mounts, execution policy, and artifact capture
        -> disposable WordPress Playground runtime
          may mount Agents API, Data Machine, Data Machine Code, providers
          runs controlled commands or sandboxed agent tasks
        <- artifact bundle: patch, changed files, tests, preview, provenance
    <- reviewed apply, export, replay, or discard
```

## Product Shape

The core use case is safe code generation for WordPress products without giving
the agent production access. A site owner, Studio user, CI job, eval runner, or
chat surface can ask for a change; WP Codebox runs the work in Playground and
returns evidence that the parent product can review.

Example control planes include hosted WordPress products, local development
tools, chat surfaces, CI jobs, GitHub Actions, Homeboy, and other host
applications. They consume WP Codebox; they do not change the sandbox contract.
wp-gym is an example implementation that can build evaluation workflows on top
of the same generic sandbox contract.

## Landed Contracts

- **Sandbox session contract:** parent control planes pass caller-owned
  `sandbox_session_id` and optional `orchestrator` metadata to correlate runs.
  WP Codebox echoes a `wp-codebox/sandbox-session/v1` envelope and artifact refs,
  but durable queued/running/cancelled/expired lifecycle remains external. See
  [`sandbox-session-contract.md`](./sandbox-session-contract.md).
- **Apply-back contract:** sandbox execution returns artifacts only. Reviewed
  apply validates `artifact_id`, `approved_files[]`, the canonical changed-file
  manifest, and the artifact content digest before delegating to the
  `wp_codebox_apply_approved_artifact` adapter. PR creation, bot identity,
  deployment, and package export stay in parent adapters. See
  [`external-apply-adapter-contract.md`](./external-apply-adapter-contract.md).
- **Batch/fan-out primitive:** `wp-codebox/run-agent-task-batch` launches one
  isolated sandbox per task sequentially and returns per-task artifact ids,
  preview URLs, statuses, and errors. Parent orchestrators such as Homeboy own
  parallelism, track their own jobs, pass correlation metadata into each sandbox
  run, and store the returned artifact ids as evidence.

## Ownership Boundaries

WP Codebox owns:

- Disposable Playground lifecycle.
- Mount normalization and sandbox workspace layout.
- Controlled command and agent-task execution.
- Artifact bundles, provenance, previews, patch surfaces, and replay metadata.
- WordPress plugin abilities that expose those sandbox operations to a host site.

Parent control planes own:

- Users, permissions, quotas, billing, durable jobs, retries, cancellation, and
  retention.
- Human review UX, approval records, and apply-back policy.
- Branch pushes, pull requests, deploys, package export, or direct apply.
- Bot identities and credentials used outside the sandbox.

In-sandbox Data Machine and Data Machine Code own only the tools mounted into a
disposable run. DMC may expose sandbox-scoped read/write/diff helpers for the
mounted workspace; parent-only operations such as worktree lifecycle, pushes,
GitSync, PR mutation, comments, deploys, and cleanup remain outside the sandbox.

## Design Rule

Keep the seams small and consumer-agnostic: session correlation, sandbox
lifecycle, command execution, artifact capture, and reviewed apply-back are
separate contracts. Integrations can add product policy around those seams
without making WP Codebox depend on a specific queue, review UI, deploy system,
or agent framework.
