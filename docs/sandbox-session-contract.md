# Sandbox Session Contract

WP Codebox keeps sandbox execution generic and host-storage agnostic. It does not
create host-site database tables or own a queue. Parent control planes that need
durable sessions should create their own job/session record, then call WP Codebox
with a caller-owned `sandbox_session_id`.

## Boundary

```text
Parent control plane
  owns users, queues, jobs, retries, cancellation, retention, and UI history
    -> calls wp-codebox/run-agent-task with sandbox_session_id
      -> WP Codebox shells out to the CLI and captures artifacts
    <- returns wp-codebox/sandbox-session/v1 for correlation

Disposable Playground sandbox
  may mount Agents API, Data Machine, Data Machine Code, and provider plugins
  owns in-sandbox agent behavior only
```

The host WP Codebox plugin should not depend on a specific parent job system.
External orchestrators, including Homeboy, consume the same abilities and
artifact contracts.

## Browser Playground Permission Model

`wp-codebox/create-browser-playground-session` returns an explicit browser
session boundary:

```json
{
  "execution": "browser-playground",
  "execution_scope": "disposable-playground",
  "permission_model": "sandbox-bypass",
  "session": {
    "execution_scope": "disposable-playground",
    "permission_model": "sandbox-bypass"
  }
}
```

The `sandbox-bypass` permission model means the generated browser runner can
temporarily bypass a caller-declared sandbox permission filter inside the
disposable Playground site so sandbox-local abilities or hook tasks can run
without inheriting host-site user state. This is safe only because the browser
runner executes in PHP-WASM inside the caller-owned Playground filesystem and
cannot grant permissions on the host WordPress site.

The generated PHP runner validates the expected Playground environment before it
adds any permission bypass. If the runner is copied into a normal host WordPress
install, it fails with `wp_codebox_browser_runner_not_playground` instead of
executing the requested sandbox invocation.

## Request Fields

`wp-codebox/run-agent-task` and `wp-codebox/run-agent-task-batch` accept these
optional correlation fields:

```json
{
  "sandbox_session_id": "external-job-123",
  "session_id": "sandbox-agent-conversation-456",
  "orchestrator": {
    "type": "data-machine-job",
    "id": "parent-site-control-plane",
    "job_id": "123"
  }
}
```

- `sandbox_session_id` is caller-owned. WP Codebox echoes it in the response and
  does not persist it.
- `session_id` remains the in-sandbox agent conversation/session id passed to the
  mounted agent runtime.
- `orchestrator` is opaque correlation metadata for external job systems.

## Response Shape

The ability response includes a `wp-codebox/sandbox-session/v1` envelope:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "schema": "wp-codebox/sandbox-session/v1",
    "id": "external-job-123",
    "status": "completed",
    "persistence": "external-orchestrator",
    "agent_session_id": "sandbox-agent-conversation-456",
    "orchestrator": {
      "type": "data-machine-job",
      "id": "parent-site-control-plane",
      "job_id": "123"
    },
    "artifacts": {
      "path": "/srv/artifacts/run-123",
      "bundle_id": "artifact-bundle-sha256-...",
      "preview_url": "https://preview.example.test/abc"
    }
  },
  "agent_result": {
    "schema": "wp-codebox/agent-result/v1",
    "status": "completed",
    "actionable": true,
    "summary": "Agent sandbox produced 2 changed files and a 1842-byte patch.",
    "changedFiles": {
      "count": 2,
      "paths": ["plugin.php", "tests/plugin-test.php"],
      "artifact": "files/changed-files.json"
    },
    "patch": {
      "bytes": 1842,
      "artifact": "files/patch.diff"
    },
    "transcript": {
      "artifact": "files/transcript.json",
      "executionCount": 1
    }
  }
}
```

The `status` field describes the synchronous WP Codebox call result. Durable
queued/running/cancelled/expired transitions belong to the external orchestrator.

## Agent Result Evidence

Agent sandbox recipe runs also write these additive artifact files:

- `files/agent-result.json` uses `wp-codebox/agent-result/v1` and summarizes
  actionability, changed-file count, patch bytes, transcript location, failures,
  no-op reason, and workspace-tool diagnostics.
- `files/transcript.json` uses `wp-codebox/agent-transcript/v1` and captures the
  bounded stdout/stderr plus parsed JSON for each `wp-codebox.agent-sandbox-run`
  workflow step.

The recipe-run JSON exposes the same compact `agentResult` object, and the host
WordPress ability mirrors it as `agent_result`. Empty patches and empty
`changed-files.json` are explicit non-actionable no-op results even when the
process exits successfully.

## External Orchestrator Responsibilities

- Store durable job/session state and user ownership.
- Enforce quotas, cancellation, concurrency, and retention.
- Decide whether to retry failed runs.
- Store links to returned artifact ids and preview URLs.
- Call WP Codebox artifact abilities for review, discard, or approved apply-back.

WP Codebox owns the sandbox run and artifact contract. It intentionally does not
own the parent site's job tables or product lifecycle UI.
