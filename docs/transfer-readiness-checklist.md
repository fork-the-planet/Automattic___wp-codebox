# Transfer Readiness Architecture Checklist

WP Codebox is preparing to move from a personal prototype substrate toward
Automattic-owned infrastructure. This checklist defines the architecture review
surface that should be clean before transfer: package boundaries, artifact
lifecycle, extension seams, browser runtime dependencies, ability contracts,
security gates, and generic parent-control-plane integration seams.

Use this document as a transfer review checklist, not a roadmap for moving
product behavior into WP Codebox. WP Codebox should own the generic sandbox and
artifact substrate. Product orchestrators should own durable jobs, UX, product
semantics, and apply policy.

```text
Product control plane
  owns users, jobs, policy, review, PRs, deploys, SSI/BAC semantics
    -> WP Codebox contracts
      owns runtime policy, Playground lifecycle, mounts, execution, artifacts
        -> disposable WordPress Playground runtime
          loads caller-provided plugins, themes, MU plugins, and agent tools
        <- artifact bundle, preview refs, changed files, provenance
    <- review, apply, export, replay, or discard outside WP Codebox
```

## Transfer Acceptance Bar

- A new maintainer can identify which package owns each runtime concern without
  reading product-specific consumer code.
- Runtime inputs and outputs are versioned through documented contracts rather
  than implicit CLI output parsing.
- Artifact bundles are durable enough for review, replay, and apply decisions
  after the disposable Playground runtime is gone.
- Caller-provided extensions are loaded through generic recipe/runtime fields,
  not hard-coded consumer, importer, compiler, or personal project assumptions.
- Security-sensitive behavior fails closed: tool allow-lists, file path bounds,
  host/resource controls, secret handling, artifact digest checks, and reviewed
  apply-back all have explicit gates.
- Package names, repository URLs, release artifacts, and dependency ownership are
  ready for the target Automattic namespace before transfer.
- The namespace transfer plan in `docs/transfer-namespace-plan.md` has been
  reviewed, and any rename waits for explicit target package and repository
  decisions rather than product-specific consumer assumptions.

## Package Boundaries

Current workspace packages:

- `packages/runtime-core` owns backend-agnostic contracts: runtime policy,
  command registry, task input, workspace policy, recipe schemas, artifact
  verification, sandbox Data Machine tool policy, and shared types.
- `packages/runtime-playground` owns the WordPress Playground backend adapter:
  Playground boot, command routing, WP-CLI/PHP/browser command runners,
  snapshots, observations, mounted-file capture, diagnostics, and artifact bundle
  assembly.
- `packages/cli` owns operator automation: command parsing, recipe parsing,
  recipe source preparation, workflow phase execution, evidence finalization,
  artifact verification commands, and human/JSON output.
- `packages/wordpress-plugin` owns the parent-site WordPress adapter: ability
  registration, WP-CLI wrappers, task input normalization, parent-side sandbox
  launch, artifact listing/get/discard/apply, pending-action staging, host
  configuration, and filter-based integration points.
- `packages/runtime-core/src/sandbox-tool-policy.ts` defines the generic
  resolved sandbox tool policy snapshot shape enforced across JS and PHP
  boundaries. Product-specific tool taxonomy lives with the caller.

Transfer checklist:

- Keep generic runtime contracts in `runtime-core`; avoid importing Playground,
  CLI, WordPress plugin, product-specific, importer, compiler, benchmark, or
  orchestration semantics into that package.
- Keep backend-specific behavior in `runtime-playground`; expose it through the
  `RuntimeBackend` contract and command registry instead of direct caller hooks.
- Keep product orchestration out of `cli`; the CLI should execute recipes and
  return artifacts, not own durable queues, PR creation, deployment, billing,
  review UX, or model-evaluation scoring.
- Keep the WordPress plugin as a parent-site adapter; it should expose abilities
  and host configuration without depending on a specific product database, queue,
  UI, or Data Machine install beyond optional integration filters.
- Track helper deduplication through issue #344 so shared object/hash/artifact
  helpers move to stable package homes without creating dependency cycles.

## Runtime Artifact Lifecycle

The durable lifecycle is:

```text
task input / recipe / run args
  -> normalize and validate policy
  -> prepare mounts, staged files, plugin/runtime dependencies, site seeds
  -> create Playground runtime
  -> execute commands, workflow steps, browser actions, or agent task
  -> observe runtime state and collect diagnostics
  -> capture mounted files, diffs, changed files, patch, logs, traces, previews
  -> write manifest, metadata, review, replay/reference data, provenance
  -> destroy or hold preview runtime
  -> parent reviews artifact bundle outside the sandbox
```

Transfer checklist:

- Preserve `wp-codebox/task-input/v1` as the product-facing task envelope for
  `goal`, `target`, `allowed_tools`, `expected_artifacts`, `policy`, and
  non-secret `context`.
- Preserve `wp-codebox/sandbox-session/v1` as a correlation envelope only;
  durable queued/running/cancelled/expired state remains parent-owned.
- Preserve artifact identity as content-addressed evidence: `manifest.json`
  `id` must match `artifact-bundle-sha256-<contentDigest>`.
- Keep `files/changed-files.json` and `files/patch.diff` as the canonical apply
  input pair checked by parent-side artifact verification.
- Keep artifact provenance explicit: runtime backend, policy, mounts, workspace
  root, caller metadata, redacted inheritance state, command traces, and digest
  metadata should be recorded in bundle metadata or evidence files.
- Treat previews as artifact references, not durable runtime ownership. A live
  preview URL can expire; artifact review data should still explain whether the
  preview was held, expired, or unavailable.
- Track runtime reference/replay index completion through issue #316 so browser
  artifacts include enough generic local-file reference metadata for downstream
  asset mapping without teaching WP Codebox SSI/BAC semantics.

## Extension Seams

WP Codebox should let callers provide runtime ingredients while preserving a
generic substrate boundary.

Transfer checklist:

- Support caller-provided plugins through `extraPlugins` with explicit source,
  slug, plugin file, activation behavior, optional hash, and `loadAs` mode.
- Support caller-provided MU plugins through the same generic runtime dependency
  path; prove load order and invocation through issue #317.
- Support caller-provided themes and workspaces as mounts with opaque metadata
  that WP Codebox preserves but does not interpret as product topology.
- Support sandbox-local abilities/tasks as runtime behavior loaded by caller
  plugins, not as hard-coded product repair commands in WP Codebox core.
- Preserve mount metadata such as repo, branch, component, workspace ref,
  source mode, and WordPress content path as opaque provenance for parent
  adapters.
- Keep provider plugins generic: WP Codebox can mount and activate provider
  plugins, but provider-specific credentials and behavior remain owned by the
  provider and parent control plane.
- Avoid introducing direct imports, command names, options, or schemas that name
  product consumers, importers, compilers, benchmarks, rewards, graders, or
  personal projects inside generic runtime packages.

## Browser Runtime Dependencies

Browser sessions are a runtime mode, not a product feature. They should expose
generic browser capabilities and accept caller-owned runtime dependencies.

Transfer checklist:

- Keep `wp-codebox/create-browser-playground-session` and related browser paths
  generic: goal, mounts, runtime dependencies, preview configuration, browser
  probes/actions, artifacts, and session metadata.
- Load caller-provided browser/runtime plugins through documented recipe or
  ability input fields; avoid product-specific defaults that assume any caller.
- Treat browser action results, screenshots, console logs, HTTP observations,
  and generated files as artifacts with redaction and manifest entries.
- Keep the Playground permission bypass bounded to disposable browser runtimes;
  the generated runner must continue to fail when copied into a normal host site.
- Audit package dependencies and generated browser assets before transfer so the
  target owner knows which dependencies are runtime-critical, build-only,
  browser-only, or inherited from `@wp-playground/cli`.
- Track the generic runtime dependency and MU-plugin invocation path through
  issue #317.

## Ability Contracts

The WordPress plugin should expose a small host-facing contract that is stable
enough for products to integrate without binding WP Codebox to their internals.

Transfer checklist:

- `wp-codebox/run-agent-task` accepts structured task input, parent correlation
  metadata, optional provider/model hints, configured component paths, mounted
  workspaces, runtime dependencies, and non-secret context.
- `wp-codebox/run-agent-task-batch` fans out into isolated sandboxes and returns
  per-task status, artifact ids, preview URLs, and errors; parent orchestrators
  own parallelism and durable state.
- `wp-codebox/list-artifacts`, `wp-codebox/get-artifact`, and
  `wp-codebox/discard-artifact` operate inside the configured artifact root with
  path validation.
- `wp-codebox/stage-artifact-apply` stages a review action when Data Machine
  pending actions are available and fails closed when they are not.
- `wp-codebox/apply-approved-artifact` validates bundle id, content digest,
  changed files, approved file list, and patch hash before delegating through the
  `wp_codebox_apply_approved_artifact` adapter filter.
- WP-CLI wrappers are trusted operator surfaces around the same services; they
  are automation affordances, not substitutes for ability permission callbacks.
- Ability inputs should never include raw secret values. Use connector-scoped
  inheritance and `secret_env` names resolved by the parent process.

## Security Gates

Transfer checklist:

- Runtime policy validates `network`, `filesystem`, `commands`, `secrets`, and
  `approvals`; command execution must call `assertRuntimeCommandAllowed()`.
- Network policy should be treated as declared policy where the current backend
  cannot enforce it fully; transfer notes should identify which fields are shape
  validation versus runtime enforcement.
- Workspace policy must keep sandbox writes inside declared writable roots and
  hide configured paths from artifact capture or tool access.
- Sandbox Data Machine tools must stay on the explicit safe allow-list; parent
  worktree lifecycle, GitSync, PR mutation, issue mutation, comments, deploys,
  cleanup, and apply-back operations remain parent-only.
- Artifact access must resolve paths under the configured artifact root and reject
  outside-root traversal.
- Apply-back must require reviewed `approved_files[]` and digest-verified bundle
  content before invoking the external adapter.
- Secrets should be passed by environment-variable name or connector reference,
  redacted from recipes, logs, metadata, patches, and review files, and excluded
  from artifact provenance except for sanitized availability/status metadata.
- Generated browser runners that bypass host permission checks must assert they
  are executing inside a disposable Playground runtime before registering the
  bypass.

## Parent Integration Without Coupling

Product control planes should integrate by calling WP Codebox, passing runtime
ingredients, and consuming artifacts. WP Codebox should not learn any caller's
product model.

Transfer checklist:

- Parent control planes own projects, prompts, artifact state, UI, repair loop
  decisions, diagnostics presentation, review UX, and product-specific
  job/session state.
- Parent control planes can pass generated source trees as mounts, pass runtime
  plugins or MU plugins, request browser sessions, run generic browser actions,
  and read artifact bundles.
- Importer and compiler semantics stay outside WP Codebox. WP Codebox may
  produce generic files, patches, browser observations, reference indexes, and
  provenance that those products consume.
- Repair agents should be injected as caller-provided sandbox code or
  sandbox-local tasks, then return changed files and summaries as normal WP
  Codebox artifacts.
- Apply/materialization paths should use parent-owned adapters and artifact
  review; WP Codebox should not push branches, open PRs, import static sites, or
  mutate production product state directly.

## Transfer Follow-Up Issues

- #344: Deduplicate shared object, hash, and artifact manifest helpers so package
  boundaries stay clear after the architecture split.
- #346: Expand architecture docs for package responsibilities, runtime lifecycle,
  recipe lifecycle, artifact lifecycle, and command policy relationships.
- #317: Support caller-provided sandbox MU plugins and sandbox-local task
  invocation for repair runtimes without product or importer coupling.
- #316: Generate a generic runtime reference index for browser artifacts so
  downstream asset mapping can consume references without AI-authored manifests.
- #357: Replace personal package namespace and repository URLs once the target
  Automattic package/repo policy is known. See
  `docs/transfer-namespace-plan.md` for the current inventory and mechanical
  checklist.
- #358: Classify browser runtime and packaging dependencies so transfer reviewers
  can distinguish runtime-critical, browser-only, build-only, generated, and
  transitive Playground dependencies.

## Transfer Review Questions

- Which package names and npm scopes will be used after Automattic ownership?
- Which release artifact is authoritative for each environment: npm package,
  plugin zip, or both as one release unit?
- Which browser/runtime dependencies are intentionally public API, runtime
  implementation detail, or build-time-only?
- Which host is responsible for long-term artifact retention and deletion after
  transfer?
- Which parent adapter will own PR creation and apply-back in the first
  Automattic-hosted integration?
