# Recipe Contract

WP Codebox recipes use the `wp-codebox/workspace-recipe/v1` schema. A recipe is
a declarative sandbox setup plus ordered workflow steps. The CLI validates the
recipe before booting WordPress Playground, then returns a structured artifact
bundle after execution.

Use the generated schema and command catalog as the source of truth:

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- schema recipe --json
npm run wp-codebox -- commands --json
```

Validate recipes before using them in CI or documentation examples:

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe validate --recipe ./path/to/recipe.json --json
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe-run --recipe ./path/to/recipe.json --dry-run --json
```

## Minimal Shape

```json
{
  "schema": "wp-codebox/workspace-recipe/v1",
  "runtime": {
    "backend": "wordpress-playground",
    "wp": "latest"
  },
  "inputs": {
    "mounts": [
      {
        "source": "../my-plugin",
        "target": "/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin",
        "mode": "readonly"
      }
    ]
  },
  "workflow": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "command": "wordpress.run-php",
        "args": ["code=echo get_bloginfo( 'name' );"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Stable Field Names

Recipe field names are case-sensitive. The current recipe schema accepts these
top-level fields:

- `schema`
- `distribution`
- `runtime`
- `inputs`
- `workflow`
- `artifacts`
- `probes`

`inputs` accepts these fields:

- `mounts`
- `workspaces`
- `extra_plugins`
- `component_manifest`
- `dependency_overlays`
- `runtimeEnv`
- `secretEnv`
- `pluginRuntime`
- `fixtureDatabases`
- `siteSeeds`
- `stagedFiles`
- `agent_bundles`
- `inherit`
- `inheritance`

Use `inputs.extra_plugins`, not `inputs.extraPlugins`. The camelCase form is an
old docs/example drift and is not part of `wp-codebox/workspace-recipe/v1`.

Use `inputs.agent_bundles`, not `inputs.agentBundles`, for runtime agent bundle
imports.

## Extra Plugins

`inputs.extra_plugins` mounts additional WordPress plugins before workflow steps
run. Each entry requires `source` and may include `slug`, `pluginFile`,
`activate`, `loadAs`, and `sha256`.

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "extra_plugins": [
      {
        "source": "https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/bbpress.latest-stable.zip",
        "pluginFile": "bbpress/bbpress.php",
        "activate": false
      },
      {
        "source": "../agents-api",
        "slug": "agents-api",
        "pluginFile": "agents-api/agents-api.php",
        "activate": false,
        "loadAs": "mu-plugin"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Supported `loadAs` values:

- `plugin`: mount below `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/<slug>` and activate when
  `activate` is not `false`.
- `mu-plugin`: mount below
  `/wordpress/wp-content/mu-plugins/wp-codebox-runtime/<slug>` and load through
  WP Codebox's generated MU-plugin loader. Use this for sandbox runtime
  substrate, not user-visible plugins.

External HTTPS zip downloads are gated by `WP_CODEBOX_ALLOW_NETWORK_DOWNLOADS=1`.
Local paths are resolved relative to the recipe file.

## Workflow Steps

Workflow steps are ordered command invocations:

```json
{
  "command": "wordpress.wp-cli",
  "args": ["command=option get home"]
}
```

Each `args` entry is a string. Command-specific argument names and repeatability
come from the command catalog:

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- commands --json
```

Use `allowFailure: true` or `advisory: true` for evidence-only workflow steps.
Failed advisory steps are reported in `advisoryFailures` and do not make an
otherwise successful recipe return `success: false`.

## Fixture Imports And Bootstrap Declarations

`inputs.siteSeeds` is the generic fixture import primitive. JSON fixture seeds
import through WordPress APIs for posts, options, terms, users, media, active
plugins, and active theme declarations. Those APIs can make semantic identifiers
stable, such as post slugs, term slugs, option names, user logins, plugin files,
and theme stylesheets. They cannot guarantee numeric primary keys.

Use `deterministicIds` to make that boundary explicit:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "siteSeeds": [
      {
        "type": "fixture",
        "name": "demo-content",
        "source": "fixtures/content.json",
        "format": "json",
        "deterministicIds": {
          "strategy": "platform-identifiers",
          "onUnsupported": "block"
        },
        "scopes": {
          "posts": { "slugs": ["home"] },
          "options": { "names": ["blogname"] }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When `onUnsupported` is `block`, WP Codebox reports a validation/runtime blocker
if the generic importer sees numeric `id`/`ID` fixture fields or a recipe requests
the `numeric` strategy. Custom importers may add format-specific support later,
but the generic contract stays honest about what platform APIs can guarantee.

Recipes may also attach reusable bootstrap declarations to a site seed:

```json
{
  "bootstrap": {
    "multisite": {
      "enabled": true,
      "install": "subdomain",
      "sites": [{ "domain": "example.test", "path": "/", "title": "Example" }]
    },
    "domains": [{ "domain": "example.test", "path": "/", "primary": true }]
  }
}
```

These are generic declarations for orchestrators and future runtime setup
support. The current built-in fixture importer treats multisite/domain bootstrap
as declared metadata and blocks executable fixture imports that require runtime
setup not yet provided by WP Codebox.

```json
{
  "command": "wordpress.browser-actions",
  "args": ["url=/", "steps-json=[...]"],
  "advisory": true
}
```

## Fixture Browser Auth Storage State

Hosts that need an authenticated browser session for a disposable WordPress
sandbox can use the playground package's fixture auth storage-state helpers
instead of baking product-specific site identifiers into recipes. The helper
contract is generic: resolve or create a named WordPress fixture user inside the
sandbox, mint short-lived WordPress admin cookies for declared browser origins,
and return a Playwright-compatible `storageState` envelope:

```ts
import { wordpressFixtureUserStorageStatePhpCode } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-playground"
```

The emitted PHP returns `wp-codebox/browser-auth-storage-state/v1`:

```json
{
  "schema": "wp-codebox/browser-auth-storage-state/v1",
  "kind": "wordpress-fixture-user-admin-auth",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "wp-codebox-fixture-admin",
    "email": "wp-codebox-fixture-admin@example.test",
    "role": "administrator",
    "created": true
  },
  "storageState": {
    "cookies": [],
    "origins": []
  }
}
```

Callers own when to run the PHP and where to persist the returned storage-state
JSON. Product policy, production identifiers, and cross-site account mapping stay
outside WP Codebox.

## Recipe Output Evidence

`recipe-run --json` returns `wp-codebox/recipe-run/v1`. Browser command sidecars
are promoted into `browserEvidence` so callers can discover stable evidence
without hardcoding artifact paths or parsing command stdout.

The same output includes `result`, a normalized
`wp-codebox/recipe-run-summary/v1` envelope for portable callers. It groups
common artifact refs, command stdout/stderr tails, run/runtime metadata, failure
phase and summary, and held-preview reviewer access. Consumers should prefer
`result` before scraping `latest-runtime.json`, `commands.jsonl`, command stdout,
or preview internals from the artifact bundle.

Each `browserEvidence` entry includes the workflow phase/index, command,
summary file, artifact file refs, summary payload, and `scriptResult` when the
browser command produced one. The same browser evidence is mirrored into
`latest-runtime.json` under the run artifact pointer.

`--preview-hold-seconds <duration>` records held-preview lifecycle metadata in the
artifact bundle and returns after recipe work finishes. Use
`--preview-hold-blocking` only for operator workflows that need the CLI process
to keep a live preview server open for the hold duration.

## Generic Host Command Primitive

Hosts that expose recipe/task runner commands through WP Codebox should use the
core `executeHostCommand()` primitive instead of hand-rolled process wrappers. It
runs one command without shell expansion, enforces allowed working-directory and
environment policy, times out long-running work, terminates the spawned process
group, samples process-tree RSS, and returns a structured result with:

- `failureClassification`: `none`, `timeout`, `non_zero_exit`, or `signal`.
- `commandSummary`: a compact command line for human diagnostics.
- Bounded `stdout` and `stderr` fields plus `outputTruncated`.
- `memorySamples` and `peakRssBytes` for runner watchdog evidence.
- Optional `artifacts.stdout`, `artifacts.stderr`, and `artifacts.summary` refs
  when `artifactsDirectory` is provided.

The summary artifact uses `wp-codebox/host-command-summary/v1`. Product-specific
orchestrators can wrap this primitive, but should keep WPCOM, CI-provider, and
deployment semantics outside the generic runner layer.

## WordPress PHPUnit Runtime

`wordpress.phpunit` is the lightweight WP Codebox equivalent of plugin PHPUnit
commands commonly run through `wp-env run ... vendor/bin/phpunit`. It boots a
disposable WordPress Playground runtime, mounts the tested plugin at
`/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/<plugin-slug>`, prepares the WordPress PHPUnit
contract, and captures command output in the artifact bundle.

The runtime provides:

- `WP_TESTS_DIR` pointing at the configured WordPress tests library.
- `WP_TESTS_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` and `WP_PHPUNIT__TESTS_CONFIG` pointing at the
  generated `wp-tests-config.php`.
- An isolated SQLite test database via `DB_NAME=':memory:'`.
- A plugin working directory via `cwd=<sandbox path>`, matching the practical
  role of `wp-env run --env-cwd`.
- Structured diagnostics in the recipe artifact bundle, including the raw test
  result log collected from `/tmp/wp-codebox-phpunit-result.txt`.

Use `recipe build phpunit` when generating recipes for plugin CI or offloaded lab
runners:

```json
{
  "pluginSlug": "woocommerce",
  "pluginSource": "../woocommerce/plugins/woocommerce",
  "cwd": "/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce",
  "autoloadFile": "/wp-codebox-vendor/autoload.php",
  "testsDir": "/wp-codebox-vendor/wp-phpunit/wp-phpunit",
  "bootstrapMode": "project",
  "projectBootstrap": "tests/legacy/bootstrap.php",
  "phpunitArgs": ["--filter", "WC_Checkout_Test::test_checkout"]
}
```

```bash
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe build phpunit --options ./phpunit-options.json --output ./phpunit.recipe.json
npm run wp-codebox -- recipe-run --recipe ./phpunit.recipe.json --artifacts ./artifacts/phpunit --json
```

## Stable Recipe-Builder API

Tools that need to generate WordPress bench or PHPUnit recipes without shelling
out to the CLI may import the supported recipe-builder module:

```js
import {
  buildWordPressBenchRecipe,
  buildWordPressPhpunitRecipe,
} from "@automattic/wp-codebox-core/recipe-builders"
```

The same subpath is exported by the root release package as
`wp-codebox-workspace/recipe-builders`, so callers can use one documented module
name for npm package installs and release-tarball installs without probing
`packages/runtime-core/dist/index.js` or other internal build paths. Local
checkout consumers should run `npm run build` first, then import the same
workspace package subpath through normal Node package resolution.

The CLI surface remains the stable process boundary for hosts that prefer JSON
over an in-process import:

```bash
wp-codebox recipe build phpunit --options ./phpunit-options.json --output ./phpunit.recipe.json
wp-codebox recipe build bench --options ./bench-options.json --output ./bench.recipe.json
```

Both builders return `wp-codebox/workspace-recipe/v1` recipes. The generated
recipes should still be validated with `wp-codebox recipe validate` or
`wp-codebox recipe-run --dry-run` before execution in CI.

For monorepos such as WooCommerce, set `pluginSource` to the directory that
should appear as `wp-content/plugins/<plugin-slug>` and set `cwd` to the same
sandbox directory a `wp-env --env-cwd` command would use. Relative `cwd` values
resolve inside the mounted plugin directory.

## Browser Assertions

`wordpress.browser-probe` accepts repeated `assert=<assertion>` arguments.
Supported assertion forms are the current command contract:

- `exists:<selector>`
- `not-exists:<selector>`
- `visible:<selector>`
- `hidden:<selector>`
- `count:<selector><op><number>`
- `text:<selector> contains <text>`
- `attr:<selector>[name][=value]`
- `no-console-errors`
- `no-page-errors`
- `no-errors`
- `request-count-by-host:<host><op><number>`
- `request-count-by-type:<type><op><number>`
- `total-transfer-size<op><number>`
- metric budgets such as `lcp_ms<=2500`, `fcp_ms<=1800`,
  `ttfb_ms<=800`, and `nav_duration_ms<=5000`

Prefix an assertion with `advisory:` to record a failing assertion without
failing the command.

Do not use `assert=script:passed equals true`. That syntax is not supported by
the current WP Codebox browser assertion contract. Use `wordpress.browser-actions`
with an `evaluate` step and `assert` value when a page script must prove state:

```json
{
  "command": "wordpress.browser-actions",
  "args": [
    "url=/wp-admin/tools.php?page=my-plugin",
    "steps-json=[{\"kind\":\"evaluate\",\"expression\":\"window.myPluginReady === true\",\"assert\":true}]"
  ]
}
```

Recipes that use a browser-actions `evaluate` step require the runtime policy to
allow `wordpress.browser-actions.evaluate` in addition to
`wordpress.browser-actions`.

## Keeping Examples Current

When editing docs or example recipes:

- Prefer generated schema output over hand-written field lists.
- Run `recipe validate` against every recipe changed.
- Run `recipe-run --dry-run --json` when changing mounts, workspaces,
  `extra_plugins`, secrets, or workflow args.
- Keep product-specific orchestration, scoring, PR creation, and deployment out
  of recipes. Parent control planes own those behaviors.
