# Generic Runtime Primitives

WP Codebox exposes generic contracts for parent control planes without naming a
product or job system.

## Contract Authority

- TypeScript implementations live in `packages/runtime-core/src/artifact-storage.ts`,
  `packages/runtime-core/src/browser-session-origin.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/runtime-neutral-contracts.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/materialization-contracts.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/evidence-artifact-envelope.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/runtime-overlay-bundle.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/runtime-boundary-contracts.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/runtime-profile-compiler.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/provider-runtime-contracts.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/command-agent-run.ts`, and
  `packages/runtime-core/src/wordpress-workload-primitives.ts`.
- Coverage lives in `tests/generic-primitives.test.ts` and
  `tests/command-agent-run.test.ts`, plus
  `tests/wordpress-workload-primitives.test.ts` for workload helpers and
  `tests/runtime-package-execution.test.ts` for runtime package execution.
- `npm run check` runs that coverage through the smoke manifest `core` group.

## Artifact Storage

`wp-codebox/runtime-artifact-storage/v1` describes where runtime artifacts can be
written and how relative artifact paths map to public URLs when a public root is
available.

- `root` is an absolute writable filesystem root.
- `publicUrlRoot` is an optional normalized `http://` or `https://` URL root.
- `pathPrefix` is an optional safe relative prefix applied before artifact refs.

## Browser Session Origins

`wp-codebox/trusted-browser-session-origin/v1` normalizes trusted CORS origins for
browser-session bridges. `https://` origins are accepted. `http://` is accepted
only for loopback hosts.

## Materialization Results

`wp-codebox/materialization-phase-result/v1` records phase status and artifact
references produced while converting runtime output into durable artifacts. These
refs can be folded into run records as `materialization:<kind>` artifact refs.

`wp-codebox/materialization-result/v1` is the generic materialization envelope.
It records `status` (`completed`, `failed`, or `skipped`), ordered `phases`,
artifact refs, diagnostics, and optional caller projections. Product-specific
views such as browser artifact persistence or WordPress replay packages belong in
`projections[]`; the core envelope stays caller-neutral and represents failures
without requiring callers to recover information from thrown errors.

## Evidence Artifact Envelopes

`wp-codebox/evidence-artifact-envelope/v1` is a caller-neutral envelope for
review artifacts produced by runtime workflows. It keeps product policy outside
WP Codebox while giving upstream consumers one stable shape for browser captures
and reviewer-safe artifact references.

- Artifact refs use bundle-relative paths, never host filesystem paths.
- Optional `publicUrl` values must be `http://` or `https://` and cannot point at
  loopback hosts such as `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
- Browser captures use `wp-codebox/browser-evidence-capture/v1` and group the
  screenshot, HTML, console, network, review, or other artifacts for one browser
  scenario without naming a downstream product.

```ts
import { evidenceArtifactEnvelope } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-core"

const envelope = evidenceArtifactEnvelope({
  id: "run-1",
  subject: { kind: "component", id: "example" },
  status: "passed",
  artifacts: [{ path: "files/review.md", kind: "review" }],
  browserCaptures: [{
    id: "homepage",
    status: "passed",
    finalUrl: "https://example.test/",
    artifacts: [{ path: "files/browser/home.png", kind: "browser-screenshot" }],
  }],
})
```

## Runtime Overlay Bundles

`wp-codebox/runtime-overlay-bundle/v1` is a generic runtime overlay metadata
primitive for recipe authors and backend implementations. It describes what an
overlay needs without encoding downstream product policy or executing the
overlay by itself.

- `files` declare sandbox files with local sources or inline contents.
- `configPreludes` declare ordered snippets or files a backend can prepend to
  runtime configuration.
- `localRoutes` declare loopback-only route aliases; routes must set
  `localOnly: true`.
- `patches` record patch provenance with source and optional digest metadata.
- `capabilities` is a manifest of provided, required, and optional capability
  strings.
- `unsupportedGaps` are explicit fail-closed blockers. `runtimeOverlayBundle()`
  throws when any are present so callers do not silently run with a partial
  overlay.

Recipe schema accepts these bundles through `runtime.overlays[]`:

```json
{
  "kind": "runtime-overlay-bundle",
  "bundle": {
    "schema": "wp-codebox/runtime-overlay-bundle/v1",
    "id": "example-runtime-overlay",
    "files": [{ "path": "/wordpress/wp-content/mu-plugins/example.php", "source": "overlays/example.php" }],
    "configPreludes": [{ "target": "wp-config.php", "contents": "define('EXAMPLE_RUNTIME', true);", "order": 10 }],
    "localRoutes": [{ "path": "/_runtime/example", "target": "http://127.0.0.1:9400/example", "localOnly": true }],
    "patches": [{ "id": "example.patch", "source": "patches/example.patch", "appliesTo": "runtime" }],
    "capabilities": { "provided": ["example/runtime-overlay"] }
  }
}
```

## Neutral WordPress Runtime Intent

Recipes can omit `runtime.backend` or set it to `wordpress`. WP Codebox currently
normalizes that neutral WordPress runtime name to the existing
`wordpress-playground` backend implementation. The `wordpress-playground` spelling
is still accepted for existing recipes and low-level compatibility.

`runtime-neutral-contracts.ts` also exports helper-only setup intent types for
callers that need to describe desired setup before compiling it into recipe
fields:

- `RuntimeWordPressSetupPlanIntent` groups component and filesystem intent for a
  WordPress sandbox setup plan.
- `RuntimeWordPressComponentIntent` describes components such as plugins,
  mu-plugins, themes, WordPress core, and runtime overlays.
- `RuntimeWordPressFilesystemIntent` describes intended sandbox filesystem
  materialization, including target path, mode, and purpose.

These intent types are public documentation helpers. Runtime execution still uses
the concrete recipe fields such as `inputs.extra_plugins`, `inputs.mounts`,
`inputs.stagedFiles`, `runtime.stack.mounts`, and `runtime.overlays`.

## Runtime Profiles

`wp-codebox/runtime-profile/v1` is the caller-facing runtime request/result
contract for agent-capable WordPress sandboxes. It exposes generic capabilities,
components, readiness, diagnostics, and provenance while backend adapters resolve
plugin paths, overlays, activation order, and readiness details internally.

See [`runtime-profile-contract.md`](./runtime-profile-contract.md) for the field
contract and examples.

## Target Context Provisioning

`wp-codebox target provision --json` emits a `wp-codebox/target-context/v1`
envelope. The command does not start a runtime or persist state; it gives callers
a normalized target/session/storage context they can pass into recipes, browser
sessions, or external orchestrators.

Example:

```sh
wp-codebox target provision --json \
  --id example \
  --kind wordpress-site \
  --workspace-root /workspace \
  --artifact-public-url-root https://artifacts.example.test/run-1 \
  --trusted-origin https://preview.example.test
```

## Command Agent Runs

`command-agent-run` is a product-neutral runtime command wrapper. It executes one
declared runtime command and emits a `wp-codebox/command-agent-run/v1` envelope
with stdout, stderr, exit code, normalized status, optional parsed JSON, session
metadata, auth context keys, environment variable names, diagnostics, and artifact
refs.

The wrapper fails closed:

- `command` is required.
- The target command must already be allowed by runtime policy.
- `command-agent-run` cannot target itself.
- `auth-required=true` requires `auth-context-json`.
- Runtime metadata is required before an envelope can be created.

Environment reporting includes names only. Runtime and secret environment values
are not included in the envelope.

Example recipe step:

```json
{
  "command": "command-agent-run",
  "args": [
    "command=inspect-mounted-inputs",
    "args-json=[]",
    "parse-json=false",
    "session-id=example-session",
    "correlation-id=example-correlation"
  ]
}
```

## Provider Runtime Invocation Contract

`buildGenericAbilityRuntimeRunRecipe()` includes
`runtime_invocation.provider_runtime_contract` in the ability input. The contract
is the generic runtime-provider handshake introduced by PR #1205: workspace
capture, workspace command execution, workspace publication, tool-call transcript
recording, artifact handoff, and runtime evidence result schemas.

WP Codebox owns the names and schemas. The runner workspace ability surface is
`wp-codebox/runner-workspace-prepare`, `wp-codebox/runner-workspace-capture`,
`wp-codebox/runner-workspace-command`, and `wp-codebox/runner-workspace-publish`.
Callers own policy: repository selection, authorization,
retries, retention, publication approval, and how resulting refs are attached to
their job records.

The contract intentionally uses WP Codebox task names and runner workspace
ability names. Downstream product names, backend ability names, and
orchestration policy stay outside the runtime invocation payload.

## Runtime Package Execution

`wp-codebox/run-runtime-package` is the public WordPress ability for executing a
runtime package. Callers should use this Codebox-owned ability id, the
`CODEBOX_RUN_RUNTIME_PACKAGE_ABILITY` constant, or `buildRuntimePackageRunRecipe()`
instead of coupling to backend adapter ability ids.

The request envelope is `wp-codebox/runtime-package-execution-input/v1`:

```json
{
  "schema": "wp-codebox/runtime-package-execution-input/v1",
  "runtime_package": "example/runtime-package",
  "input": { "prompt": "collect evidence" },
  "artifact_declarations": [
    {
      "schema": "wp-codebox/runtime-package-artifact-declaration/v1",
      "name": "report",
      "type": "markdown",
      "direction": "output",
      "path": "files/report.md",
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "output_projections": [
    {
      "schema": "wp-codebox/runtime-package-output-projection/v1",
      "name": "summary",
      "source": "result.summary",
      "type": "text"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Artifact declarations describe typed inputs or outputs the runtime package may
consume or produce. Output projections describe named caller-facing views over the
runtime result or artifacts. WP Codebox preserves these generic declarations in
the runtime package input so downstream systems can remove product-specific
artifact special-casing while keeping projection policy outside Codebox core.

## WordPress Workload Primitives

`wordpressAbilityStep()` builds the stable `wordpress.ability` recipe step shape.
`wordpressWorkloadRunRecipe()` builds a minimal WordPress Playground-backed recipe
around caller-supplied workload steps while returning Codebox runtime descriptors
for mounts, PHP execution, OPFS use, and browser-client access.

`playgroundPreviewUrl()` emits a `wp-codebox/playground-preview-url/v1` envelope
for local, public, or secure preview URLs. Callers get the effective URL and
diagnostics while the Playground adapter remains free to change its internal
preview plumbing.

```ts
import { playgroundPreviewUrl, wordpressAbilityStep, wordpressWorkloadRunRecipe } from "@automattic/wp-codebox-core"

const recipe = wordpressWorkloadRunRecipe({
  preview: { publicUrl: "https://preview.example.test/run-1/" },
  steps: [wordpressAbilityStep({
    name: "example/do-work",
    input: { prompt: "collect evidence" },
    expectedResultSchema: "example/result/v1",
  })],
})

const preview = playgroundPreviewUrl({
  localUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:9400/",
  publicUrl: "https://preview.example.test/run-1/",
  path: "/wp-admin/",
  mode: "secure",
})
```
